Brief Fact Summary
The Virginia Industrial Commission held that Claimant employee suffered an injury by industrial accident. Defendant employer challenged the decision.<span class="heading">Synopsis of Rule of Law.</span> An obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body is required for accidents resulting from ordinary exertion to be compensable. The claimant must prove that the injury by accident arose from an identified incident that occurs at some reasonably definite time.

Facts
At the time of her injury, the employee, Sarah Cogbill, was working at a public auction of Virginia Electric & Power Company’s surplus vehicles. This was a deviation from her usual job, during which she worked at a desk and sat in a swivel chair, enjoying free movement. During the auction, she sat in a straight-backed, hardwood chair placed on the bed of a truck. Over the course of more than three hours, she carried a clipboard on her lap and recorded auction bids. During the auction, she claimed, her back began to trouble her. When the trouble persisted, she saw a doctor who diagnosed the problem as a lumbar strain, the result of her posture during the auction. The record indicated that Claimant had previous trouble with her back, and had missed work as a result. She filed a claim and the hearing commissioner awarded compensation. Virginia Electric & Power Company requested a full commission review and the commission affirmed the original decision.<span class="heading">Issue.</span> Did the Virginia Industrial Commission err in its holding that an employee’s injuries arose from an industrial accident?

Held
Yes. The court reversed holding that the injury, stemming from mere sitting, was not an industrial accident.

Discussion
The Virginia Supreme Court takes an opportunity to review the particulars that distinguish an “industrial” accident from an accident occurring in the course of normal activities.
