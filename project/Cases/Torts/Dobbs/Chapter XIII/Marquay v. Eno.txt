Brief Fact Summary
In connection with a suit by female students (Plaintiffs), against school district, officials, teachers, coaches, and employees (Defendants), arising out of allegations of exploitation, harassment, assault, and sexual abuse, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire certified state law questions.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The relation of the parties determines whether any duty to use due care is imposed by law upon one party for the benefit of another. If there is no relationship, there is no duty.

Facts
Plaintiffs, former students in a public school district, brought separate complaints alleging abuse, sexual and otherwise, by one or more of the employees of the school district. Also alleged was that several other school district employees knew, or should have known, of the abuse. The federal district court in which the suits were brought certified questions for the Supreme Court of New Hampshire.

Issue
Did the state statute create a private right of action in favor of abused children against those who have violated the statute’s reporting requirements?

Held
The court answered the certified questions (as follows) and remanded the case to the federal district court.

Discussion
Concerning the responsibility owed by municipalities to members of the general public, a special relationship must exist to create a heightened duty on the part of the municipality. Thus, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire conducts its analysis in terms of the duty owed by school district employees and whether such relationships were present in the instant case.
