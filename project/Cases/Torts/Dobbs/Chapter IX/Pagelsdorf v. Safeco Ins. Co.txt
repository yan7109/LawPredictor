91 Wis. 2d 734; 284 N.W.2d 55.

Brief Fact Summary
In Pagelsdorf’s (Plaintiff) claims of negligence in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) the jury verdict in favor of Plaintiff. Plaintiff appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A landlord is under a duty to exercise ordinary care in the maintenance of the premises.

Facts
Richard J. Mahnke (Defendant) owned a duplex, which had four balcony porches, two on each unit. He rented the upper unit to John and Mary Katherine Blattner (Blattners). Plaintiff was assisting the Blattners in moving from an apartment, when a section of balcony railing gave way. He suffered various injuries when he fell. A subsequent inspection revealed that the railing assembly had dry rot. There was evidence that Defendant had contracted for general repairs of the premises, but that the provision was limited to defects known to him.

Issue
Did the general common law principle of nonliability of landlords still apply?

Held
The Supreme Court of Wisconsin concluded that there was no remaining justification for the landlord’s general cloak of common law immunity and abolished the general common law principle of nonliability of landlords toward persons injured as a result of their defective premises. The jury verdict in favor of Defendant on Plaintiff’s claim of negligence was reversed and the case remanded.

Discussion
Pagelsdorf is representative of the departure from the traditional view, which granted landlords broad preclusion from liability for injuries occurring on their property.
