Synopsis of Rule of Law
The determination of whether or not an employee is acting within the scope of his employment is determined based on the facts of each case.

Facts
The Appellant was required to attend a sales convention conducted by his employer, Appellee #2. The Appellant drove his own car, but was reimbursed for expenses. The Appellant was encouraged to mix freely with out-of-state insurance experts in social as well as business events. On the second evening of the convention Appellant drove to a bar and restaurant to look for out-of-state colleagues. He found none and drove back to the convention center. On his way, he skidded across a highway and struck a disabled vehicle owned by Appellee #1. Appellee #1 was standing in front of his vehicle and his legs were crushed. He brought a personal injury claim against both the Appellant and Appellee #2. The jury found that Appellant was an employee acting within the scope of his employment and that Appellee #2 should be liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.

Issue
Was there sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Appellant was acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The concept of respondeat superior is one of the few exceptions to the general tort doctrine of no liability without fault.
