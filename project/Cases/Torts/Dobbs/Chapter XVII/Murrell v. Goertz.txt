1979 OK CIV APP 25, 597 P.2d 1223

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellant, Murrell (Appellant) and Bruce Goertz (Goertz) had an altercation that resulted in Goertz striking Appellant. The Appellant sued Goertz and the Appellee, his employer Oklahoma Publishing Company (Appellee), claiming that Appellee was liable under respondeat superior. Appellee and Goertz claim that Goertz was an independent contractor.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Those who employ independent contractors are not liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.

Facts
Goertz made a monthly collection for the delivery of Appellee’s newspaper at the Appellant’s home. Appellant questioned Goertz regarding damage done to his screen caused by the carrier throwing the newspaper into it. An argument began and Appellant slapped Goertz, who then struck the Appellant, injuring him. Appellant claimed that Goertz was a servant of Appellee either by agreement between the co-defendants or by Appellee creating that belief in Appellant. Both Appellee and Goertz denied that Goertz was Appellee’s servant.

Issue
Was Goertz an independent contractor rather than a servant, thus removing Appellee from liability under respondeat superior?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Independent contractors do their work on their own time, under no one’s direction, but their own.
