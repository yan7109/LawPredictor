Brief Fact Summary
Connie Steinle (Ms. Steinle) and her daughter, while they were on the way to buy a calf, were involved in a car wreck with Richard Popejoy (Mr. Popejoy). Ms. Steinle was killed in the accident. The Plaintiffs, Mr. Popejoy and Doris Popejoy (Plaintiffs) brought a suit against the Defendants, personal representatives of Ms. Steinle’s husband’s estate (Defendants), under a joint venture theory.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An interest in profit is necessary in order to impose vicarious liability on a party based on a joint venture theory.

Facts
Ms. Steinle, accompanied by her daughter and niece, were traveling to Douglas, Wyoming to buy a calf for the daughter to raise on their ranch. During the trip, the truck Ms. Steinle was driving collided with a vehicle driven by Mr. Popejoy. Ms. Steinle was killed in the accident and Mr. Popejoy suffered injuries diagnosed as a muscle strain. Approximately fifteen months later, Mr. Popejoy underwent two neurosurgeries to fuse cervical vertebrae in response to continued pain in his neck and back. Mr. Popejoy unsuccessfully tried to reopen Ms. Steinle’s estate, which had been probated and closed a year earlier. Plaintiffs then filed a creditor’s claim against the estate of Ms. Steinle’s husband, William Steinle (Mr. Steinle), whom had died in the interim. After this claim was rejected, Plaintiffs filed a claim against the Defendants, claiming that Mr. and Mrs. Steinle were engaged in a joint venture when Ms. Steinle embarked on her business trip to pick up the daughter’s calf.

Issue
Can the trip to pick up Ms. Steinle’s daughter’s calf be characterized as a joint venture with her husband, so as to impose vicarious liability on the Defendant’s representatives?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
A joint enterprise or venture allows for vicarious liability to imposed on parties to the venture based upon theories of agency.
