998 S.W.2d 605, 15 IER Cases 509 (Tex. 1999)

Brief Fact Summary
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth District of Texas affirmed a trial court’s judgment on a jury verdict for Plaintiffs in an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Defendant appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
To recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiff emotional distress; and (4) the resulting emotional distress was severe.

Facts
Plaintiffs, employees for GTE Southwest, alleged that over the course of several years, they endured severe abuse from their supervisor. Employees testified of a pattern of abusive behavior, including extensive profanity and physical intimidation. At trial, the jury found for Plaintiffs. The appellate court affirmed.

Issue
Did Defendant’s behavior go beyond the bounds of a tolerable work environment, thus constituting the intentional infliction of emotional distress?

Held
Yes. The court, in an opinion providing a detailed exegesis of the statutory scope of an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, held that the GTE supervisor’s conduct went well beyond the limits of an ordinary work dispute.

Discussion
The GTE court used the circumstances of this case as an opportunity to explore the parameters of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. It should be noted that with this offense, as with other tort claims for personal injury, a plaintiff may recover for pain and suffering, in addition to pecuniary damages. Additionally, in most jurisdictions it is no longer required that the victim suffer physical manifestations of the mental distress.
