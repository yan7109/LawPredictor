Brief Fact Summary
Albert Deuser (Mr. Deuser), found to be drunk and obnoxious at a fair, was arrested and then released by National Park Rangers. After being released, Mr. Deuser wandered into a street and was killed. The Appellants, Mr. Deuser’s survivors (Appellants), brought a claim against the Appellees, the United States and certain individuals including David Vecera (Mr. Vecera)(Appellees), under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The discretionary function exception to the FTCA disallows civil suit against the United States when the conduct complained of was based upon the exercise of a discretionary function or duty.

Facts
National Park Rangers were working a fair held on the grounds of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis. Rangers Mr. Vecera and Edward Bridges observed Mr. Deuser grabbing women on the buttocks. The rangers warned Mr. Deuser and then arrested him when he urinated in public. The rangers attempted to turn Mr. Deuser over to the St. Louis police, but they were unable to process Mr. Deuser’s arrest due to their workload. The rangers decided to release Mr. Deuser away from the fair in a parking lot. Mr. Deuser was left without money or transportation. At some time he was killed by a motorist after wandering onto an interstate highway. At the time of Ms. Deuser’s death, his blood alcohol content was 0.214. The Appellants brought this wrongful death action against the Appellees under the FTCA based on the allegedly negligent acts of the park rangers. The trial court judge dismissed the case.
