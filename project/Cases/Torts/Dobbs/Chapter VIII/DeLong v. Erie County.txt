Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a municipality voluntarily assumes a duty and negligently performs the duty, the municipality may be held liable if its conduct somehow increased the risk to defendant.

Facts
Ms. DeLong called 911 and reported an intruder attempting to break into her house. The person taking her call assured her that help was on the way, but incorrectly recorded Ms. DeLong’s address. Ms. DeLong was stabbed to death by the intruder. Evidence suggested that her life may have been saved if police had not been misdirected. Respondents brought suit against the Appellants, including Erie County (Appellants).

Issue
When a municipality assumes a duty to a particular person, is the municipality liable if it fails to perform in a non-negligent manner?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
In contrast to the facts in Riss v. City of New York, [22 N.Y.2d 579, 240 N.E.2d 860, 293 N.Y.S.2d 897 (N.Y.appell.1968)] in the present case Respondent voluntarily assumed a duty and its failure to act with reasonable care increased the risk to Ms. Delong.
