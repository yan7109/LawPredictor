251 F. Supp. 286, 149 U.S.P.Q. 129 (E.D. Pa. 1966)

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Testing Systems, Inc. (Plaintiff) and the Defendant, Magnaflux Corp. (Defendant), are both engaged in the same trade. The Defendant published statements saying the United States Government had tested the Plaintiff’s product and the Defendant’s product and found the Defendant’s product to be 40% more effective. This statement was untrue.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
For a party to sustain an action for trade libel, they must show that the defendant made statements that are false and that these statements led to a loss of business.

Facts
The Plaintiff and the Defendant are both in the business of making products to be used in non-destructive testing.

Issue
Should the Defendant’s motion to dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim for failure to state a case be upheld?

Held
Yes, unless the Plaintiff can amend the claim to include specific clients he lost because of the Defendant’s slander, within thirty days.

Discussion
Here, the court makes it clear that absent a showing of libel per se (The court fails to say what, exactly that is.) one of the elements to sustain a case of trade liable is a showing of damages.
