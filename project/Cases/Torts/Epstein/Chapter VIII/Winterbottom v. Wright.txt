152 ER 402, Volume 152<br />

Brief Fact Summary
Winterbottom (Plaintiff) was hurt when a coach broke down and threw him to the ground. Plaintiff sued Wright (Defendant), who maintained the coaches for Plaintiff’s employer.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There must be privity between parties to an action in order for that action to be maintained.

Facts
Defendant contracted with the Postmaster General to keep the coaches in a safe and secure condition. Plaintiff, a coach driver, was driving a coach serviced by Defendant and was hurt when a latent defect caused the coach to break down, throwing him to the ground and injuring him.

Issue
Must there be privity in order for Plaintiff to sue Defendant for negligence?

Held
Yes. Judgment for Defendant.

Discussion
There must be privity between parties to a suit. Privity is a legal bridge. It is a connection, or bond of union, between parties, as to some particular transaction. In this case, Plaintiff and Defendant were not in privity with one another. There was no contract between them and Defendant had not undertaken and breached any public duty.
