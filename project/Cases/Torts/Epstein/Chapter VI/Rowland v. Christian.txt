Synopsis of Rule of Law
Ordinary principles of negligence may be used to determine the liability of a landowner to a person coming onto the property.

Issue
May ordinary principles of negligence be used to determine the liability of a landowner to a person coming onto the property?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Dissent
(Justice Burke) The distinctions between trespassers, licensees, and invitees have been applied for many years. These classifications have a stability and predictability in their outcome. If these issues must be decided on a case-by-case basis under the laws of negligence, they will be bereft of the guiding principles and precedent the law has provided. It is not the proper function of a court to overturn the learning, wisdom, and experience of the past in this field; that is the domain of the Legislature.

Discussion
This court applies common law negligence on the owners and occupiers of land notwithstanding the traditional distinctions in the law.
