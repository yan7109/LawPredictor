One may be negligent by acts of omission as well as of commission, and liability will therefore attach if the act or omission to act owed to another is the direct, proximate and efficient cause of injury.

Facts

Defendant directed verdict was refused. The jury awarded Plaintiff $3,000.00. Defendant appealed.
