80 Wn.2d 161, 492 P.2d 1030, 1972 Wash.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff suffered injuries when his car collided with Defendant’s truck after Defendant made an illegal left turn. The trial court refused to allow Defendant to use the seatbelt defense, which would have reduced Plaintiff’s damage award.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The failure of a plaintiff to wear a seat belt does not limit an award for damages when the defendant is held to be negligent.

Facts
Defendant made a left turn in violation of the rules of the road. Plaintiff’s car collided with Defendant’s truck. Plaintiff was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the collision. At trial, Defendant argued that Plaintiff’s failure to wear a seatbelt was a form of contributory negligence (the so-called “seatbelt defense”). The trial judge refused to allow Defendant to amend his answer to raise the seatbelt defense. The trial judge also refused to allow Defendant’s expert to testify that if Plaintiff had warn his seatbelt, he would not have suffered injuries. The trial court returned a verdict for Plaintiff. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Does Plaintiff’s failure to wear a seat-belt limit a recovery for damages in an action for negligence?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The court pointed to the fact that wearing a seatbelt will not prevent the accident itself from occurring. The seatbelt defense is inherently different from contributory negligence. Furthermore, it is unjust to bar Plaintiff’s recovery when Plaintiff did nothing to cause the accident itself. Pay attention to the fact that in this jurisdiction, wearing a seatbelt is not required by statute in 1972.
