No.

Discussion
The excerpt included in the casebook attempts to make the point that a roomful of gold is not sufficient to equally compensate a party that has been physically injured. However, the legal amount of money in an award for money damages is not all the money in the world, even when it would take all the money in the world to fully compensate the injured party.
