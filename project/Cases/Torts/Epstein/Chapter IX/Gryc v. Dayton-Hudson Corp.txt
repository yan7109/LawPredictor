297 N.W.2d 727, 1980 Minn.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Lee Ann Gryc (Plaintiff), suffered severe burns when her pajamas were ignited by an electronic stove. The jury found that the Defendant Riegel Textile Corporation (Defendant), the manufacturer of the material the pajamas were made of, was liable and awarded Plaintiff both compensatory and punitive damages.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Punitive damages are an appropriate remedy both to punish past conduct and prevent future conduct when a defendant has demonstrated reckless disregard.

Facts
On December 8, 1980, the Plaintiff, 4 years of age, was clothed in pajamas made of a material known as flannelette. The flannelette was manufactured by the Defendant. It was untreated, but met the federal minimum standards of product flammability. On this date Plaintiff reached across the electronic stove to shut off a timer and her pajamas were instantly ignited. Plaintiff received severe burns over her upper body. The jury found for Plaintiff and awarded her both compensatory and punitive damages.

Issue
Did the trial court err by allowing the jury to subject the Defendant to punitive damages?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Punitive damages are generally reserved for intentional, reckless, or willful misconduct. Merely negligent conduct is insufficient to justify punitive damages.
