532 U.S. 992 121 S. Ct. 1651 149 L. Ed. 2d 508 2001 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs were severely injured and one was killed when their church van collided with a locomotive. The jury awarded Plaintiffs $27,876,813.31 in damages. Kansas City Southern Railway (Defendant) appealed, claiming the award to be excessive.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The inquiry into a claim of excessive damages is whether or not the trier of fact abused its discretion in assessing the amount of damages. Vast discretion is given to the jury and the appellate courts should rarely disturb an award of general damages.

Facts
A church van and a locomotive collided. Of the passengers in the van, one was killed, a second rendered quadriplegic, and a third suffered less serious injuries. Plaintiffs are the parents of the three passengers injured in the van. They sued Defendant for damages. Plaintiffs were awarded $27,876,813.31 which included future medical expenses of $17,000,000 and general damages for physical pain and suffering, mental anguish and loss of enjoyment of life in the amount of $8,000,000. Defendant appealed, claiming the damage award to be excessive.

Issue
Was the damage award excessive?

Held
Yes. Judgment for Defendant.

Discussion
The main point of this case is that the standard for the appellate review of damage awards is abuse of discretion. However, in this case, the reduction of Plaintiff’s award of money damages appears to be somewhat arbitrary. In determining the loss of enjoyment of life and amount of damage, the court simply looked at past cases. They found the highest award to be $6 million and then set this as Plaintiffs’ maximum recovery.
