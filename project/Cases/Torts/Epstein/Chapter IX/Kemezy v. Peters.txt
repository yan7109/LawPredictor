79 F.3d 33, 1996 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Kemezy (Plaintiff) sued Peters (Defendant), an Indiana policeman, claiming that Defendant had wantonly beat Plaintiff with his nightstick. The jury awarded Plaintiff punitive damages.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In punitive damage awards, Plaintiff is not required to present evidence of Defendant’s wealth.

Facts
Plaintiff sued Defendant, an Indiana policeman, under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 claiming that Defendant had wantonly beat Plaintiff with his nightstick in an altercation at a bowling alley. Defendant was moonlighting as a security guard at the time. The jury awarded Plaintiff $10,000.00 in compensatory damages and $20,000.00 in punitive damages. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Is it Plaintiff’s burden to introduce evidence concerning the defendant’s net worth?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed

Discussion
The court lists the purposes for awarding punitive damages in the first part of the opinion reprinted in the casebook. In the purposes listed, the court notes that no purpose addresses Defendant’s wealth. The court notes the irony in Defendant’s request that Plaintiff introduce evidence of Defendant’s wealth. Plaintiffs generally want to introduce evidence of Defendants’ wealth in order to show the jury what deep pockets Defendant has.
