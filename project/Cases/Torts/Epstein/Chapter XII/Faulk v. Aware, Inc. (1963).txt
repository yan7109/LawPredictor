244 N.Y.S.2d 259 (App. Div. 1963).

Brief Fact Summary
Defendants accused Faulk (Plaintiff) of having communist sympathies and affiliations. Plaintiff sued Defendants for libel.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The court will reduce an excessive compensatory damage award when there is hardly justification for it.

Facts
Plaintiff sued Aware, Inc. (Defendant) and its founder Vincent Hartnett (Defendant) for libel when Defendants accused Plaintiff of having communist sympathies and affiliations. The jury rendered a verdict awarding compensatory damages of $1,000,000.00 against three Defendants and punitive damages of $1,250,000.00 against Defendants. Defendants appealed, claiming the awards were excessive.

Issue
Is the size of the verdict, both as to compensatory and punitive damages, excessive and unrealistic?

Held
Yes. The court reduced the punitive damage award against Aware to $50,000.00 and against Hartnett to $100,000.00.

Discussion
In this case, the court stated that the jury’s compensatory award was justified, however, it was nonetheless excessive. In this case, the Court did in fact substitute its own judgment for that of the jury’s.
