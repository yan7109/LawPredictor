218 Mass. 294, 105 N.E. 896.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Economopoulos (Plaintiff), sued the Defendant, A.G. Pollard Co. (Defendant) because its clerks falsely accused him of stealing. No one was present who spoke the language that the accusation took place in except for the Plaintiff and the clerk.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
To maintain a defamation cause, publication of the defamatory statement must occur to some one other than the person defamed.

Facts
A clerk of the Defendant told the Plaintiff in English that the Plaintiff had stolen a handkerchief. The Plaintiff spoke Greek, so a Greek clerk told the Plaintiff the same thing in Greek. No evidence showed that any third person heard the charge except the floor walker. The Plaintiff brought a tort charge for maliciously accusing him of larceny by words spoken.

Issue
Can publication occur when no third person hears the slanderous statement except persons who do not speak the same language?

Held
No. Exceptions overruled.

Discussion
Publication in defamation cases does not refer to any sort of writing, but rather means communication of the words to some other person than the person defamed.
