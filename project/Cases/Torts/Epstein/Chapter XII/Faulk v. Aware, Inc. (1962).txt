231 N.Y.S.2d 270 (App. Div. 1962).

Brief Fact Summary
Defendants accused Faulk (Plaintiff) of having communist sympathies and affiliations. Plaintiff sued Defendants for libel.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A person wrongfully injured is entitled to recover for deprivation of future earning capacity, without limitation to his actual earnings preceding the injury. Opinion testimony of Plaintiff’s potential earnings, by experts familiar with his capacities, is admissible.

Facts
Plaintiff sued Aware, Inc. (Defendant) and its founder, Vincent Hartnett (Defendant) for libel when Defendants accused Plaintiff of having communist sympathies and affiliations. The jury rendered a verdict awarding compensatory damages of $1,000,000.00 against three Defendants and punitive damages of $1,250,000.00 against Defendants Aware and Vincent. Defendants appealed, claiming the awards were excessive.

Issue
Is there a rational basis for the jury’s awards in the evidence adduced and in the circumstances of this case?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory and punitive damages in a claim for libel. On review, the court will not substitute its judgment for that of the jury’s. In this case, Plaintiff offered expert testimony, which was unchallenged by Defendant. The jury award was not excessive.
