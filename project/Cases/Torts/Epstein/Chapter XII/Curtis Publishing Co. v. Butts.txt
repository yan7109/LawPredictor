Citation
389 U.S. 889 88 S. Ct. 11 19 L. Ed. 2d 197 1967 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiffs, Butts and Walker (Plaintiffs), were public figures and not public officials. Both were awarded damages for defamation. The Defendant, Curtis Publishing Co. (Defendant), appealed to extend the constitutional safeguards outlined in New York Times to public figures.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A public figure has the same standard of proof for libel as a public official does under New York Times.

Facts
The case in the casebook deals with two separate cases with different facts:

Issue
Do the constitutional safeguards required under New York Times v. Sullivan apply to a public figure who is not a public official?

Held
Yes. Judgments affirmed.

Dissent
Justice Hugo Black (J. Black) argued that it is time for the Supreme Court to abandon New York Times Co. v. Sullivan and adopt the rule to the effect that the First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution) was intended to leave the press free from the harassment of libel judgments.

Discussion
Public figures have just as much influence and access to the public as do public officials. In this case, the majority would rather have the Plaintiffs, who are public figures, use newspapers, TV shows, public appearances and the like to battle defamatory statements made without malice. In the decision in this case, the Supreme Court takes a hands-off approach in dealing with defamatory statements that were made by mistake.
