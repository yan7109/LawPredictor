Brief Fact Summary
A domesticated dog owned by Cindy Batteen bit Plaintiff. Plaintiff sued Jon Batteen and Cindy Batteen (Defendants) in negligence and in strict liability.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If the owner of a domesticated animal knows or has reason to know that the animal has abnormally dangerous propensities, then he may be held liable for negligence.

Facts
Ms. Batteen visited the home of Plaintiff. Wilbur, Ms. Batteen’s St. Bernard, was secured in the back of her pickup by a harness. Plaintiff asked if she could pet Wilbur, and Ms. Batteen consented. When Plaintiff reached up to pet Wilbur, Wilbur bit her in the face causing injuries to Plaintiff’s nose and forehead. Plaintiff received extensive medical treatment as a result of those injuries. Plaintiff sued Defendants in strict liability and negligence. Defendant was granted summary judgment as to both claims. Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
Is Defendant negligent or strictly liable for the injuries caused by his domesticated dog?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Dissent
(Justice Sabers) This court should not have affirmed the summary judgment motion. Negligence issues are best left to trial and a jury.

Discussion
In this case, the court makes a distinction between domesticated animals and wild animals. An owner is strictly liable for the harm caused by wild animals despite the care exercised. Domesticated animals are different. In this case, Defendant was not negligent because she had no reason to know Wilbur would bite Plaintiff. Defendant did not breach a duty owed to Plaintiff and thus summary judgment is appropriate.
