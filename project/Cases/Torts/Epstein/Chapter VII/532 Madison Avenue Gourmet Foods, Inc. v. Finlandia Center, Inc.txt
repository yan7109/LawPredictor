Brief Fact Summary
A section of the south wall of an office tower partially collapsed. 532 Madison Avenue Gourmet Foods, Inc., (Plaintiff) had to remain closed for five weeks. Plaintiff sued Defendant for public nuisance.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A public nuisance is actionable by a private person only if it is shown that the person suffered special injury beyond that suffered by the community at large.

Facts
A section of the south wall of 540 Madison Avenue, a 39-story office tower, partially collapsed. Bricks, mortar and other material fell onto Madison Avenue at 55th Street, a prime commercial location crammed with stores and skyscrapers. It was necessary to close off the surrounding areas. Plaintiff operates a 24-hour delicatessen, one-half block south of 540 Madison. They had to remain closed for five weeks. Other stores and entities also sued because they were shut down as well. The Supreme Court of New York dismissed Plaintiff’s public nuisance claim on the ground that the injuries were the same in kind as those suffered by all of the businesses in the community. Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
Is a public nuisance actionable by a private person only if it is shown that the person suffered special injury beyond that suffered by the community at large?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
In order for Plaintiff to maintain its action for public nuisance, they have to prove that they suffered a different type of injury. Their claim was dismissed because the injury suffered only varied in degree, not type. Plaintiff, a private individual, cannot maintain an action for public nuisance unless the harm suffered is of a different type than the community at large.
