264 F. 334, 1920 U.S. App. 1261.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff drowned when he fell into the water from the deck of a barge. Plaintiff sued Defendant, the barge owner, for negligence in failing to equip the barge with life-preserving jackets.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
To be liable for negligence the cause of the accident must be more than pure conjecture and speculation. It must be the cause in fact of the injury.

Facts
Plaintiff was on a barge when a tugboat bumped it. Plaintiff’s wife felt the bump and came out from the cabin. She discovered her husband (Plaintiff) in the water about ten feet from the barge, holding up his hands out of the water. Plaintiff did not know how to swim. Wife immediately ran back to the cabin for a small line, and when she returned with the line, Plaintiff had disappeared. Plaintiff drowned. Plaintiff’s estate brought an action against the owner of the barge (Defendant), claiming that Defendant was negligent in its failure to equip the barge with life preservers. The trial court retuned a verdict for Plaintiff. Defendant appealed.

Issue
If Defendant’s act is not a direct cause in fact of the accident, but merely a matter of speculation, is it liable to Plaintiff for negligence?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
The cause of his death was falling in the water and not being able to swim. There is no evidence presented by Plaintiff that the failure to equip a barge with life preserving jackets would have caused Plaintiff’s death.
