Facts
Fischer (D) was convicted of raping a fellow college student with whom, hours before the alleged rape, he had had a consensual sexual encounter. D argued at trial that in light of the previous encounter, he reasonably believed that his actions during the second encounter were consensual. D was convicted and subsequently retained new counsel, advancing the argument on appeal that the trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to request that the jury be instructed that if it found that the appellant reasonably believed that the victim consented to his advances that it could find D not guilty.
