Brief Fact Summary
The Defendants, Robert Nejdl, M.D., and Neil Barber, M.D., were charged with murder after they removed a patient, Clarence Herbert, from life support. The patient’s family requested his removal, and the Defendants believed that Mr. Herbert would never recover.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A physician has no duty to continue treatment once it has proved to be ineffective.

Facts

He was revived and immediately placed on life support equipment. Over the next few days, it was determined that Mr. Herbert was in a deeply comatose state and unlikely to recover. Several tests and examinations by specialists revealed that Mr. Herbert had suffered severe brain damage, leaving him in a vegetative state, which was likely to be permanent. His family decided to have him removed from all life-sustaining equipment, and the Defendants honored said request. Defendants were thereafter charged with murder.
