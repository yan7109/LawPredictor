35 Cal. 3d 798, 678 P.2d 886,201 Cal. Rptr. 311, 1984 Cal. 166.

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant was convicted of both felony child abuse and second-degree murder after beating her two-year-old daughter to death.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Where the conduct constituting a felony is the sole cause of death, i.e. assault, the felony “merges” with the homicide into a single crime.

Facts
The Defendant and her two daughters, Bethany, age three and a half, and Amy, age two, lived with David Foster. On the date in question, the Defendant took Amy into her bedroom after Amy disobeyed her. The Defendant spanked Amy and slapped her in the face. The Defendant hit Amy repeatedly, knocking her to the floor. Foster apparently joined in the beating to “assist” in Amy’s discipline. Eventually, the Defendant knocked Amy backwards. She fell, hitting her head on the closet door. Amy stiffened and went into respiratory arrest. The Defendant and Foster took her to the hospital where she died that evening.

Issue
Was the Defendant properly convicted of both felony child abuse and second-degree murder?

Held
No.

Discussion
The “merger” doctrine forbids conviction of both a felony and a murder if the felony relates to conduct that directly causes the death. For example, if a person robs another and then beats him to death, he cannot be convicted of both assault and murder since the assault led to the murder. However, he can be convicted of both robbery and murder since the conduct leading to the robbery charge was separate and distinct from the conduct causing the murder.
