26 S.D. 426,128 N.W. 580,1910 S.D.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant was charged with a crime against nature for committing oral sex upon a 6 year old boy.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
South Dakota’s “crimes against nature” statute goes beyond common law sodomy to include oral sex as well.

Facts
Appellant was charged with willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously making an assault upon a 6-year-old boy with the intent then and there to commit in and upon the person the detestable and abominable crime against nature in violation of section 351 of the Penal Code of South Dakota. The Jury returned a guilty verdict and appellant was sentenced to 3 years in prison. Appellant appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial.

Issue
Does the “crimes against nature” statute, as prescribed in the South Dakota penal code, include oral sex?

Held
Yes, the judgment of the trial court and the denial of a new trial are affirmed.

Discussion
The South Dakota Statute did not specifically mention “sodomy” but referred to the crime as a “detestable and abominable crime against nature.” The court finds oral sex to be many times more detestable and abominable than sodomy and reasons that not including oral sex within their statute is akin to holding that the killing of a human being in some peculiar and practically unheard of manner is not murder simply because such killing was committed in an unusual way.
