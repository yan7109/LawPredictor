150 U.S. 442,14 S. Ct. 144, 37 L. Ed. 1137,1893 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant was present at the time a person was murdered. Defendant was convicted of murder. Defendant appealed arguing that he was present but did not participate.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There must be a prior agreement or conspiracy demonstrated by sufficient evidence to find Defendant guilty of the crime.

Facts
Defendant Hicks was jointly indicted with Stan Rowe for murder. As they were escaping after the murder, Rowe was killed and Defendant was captured. At trial, the Government’s evidence demonstrated that although Defendant did not actually fire the shot that killed Rowe, he participated with Rowe in inducing the victim into the street where he was killed.

Issue
Whether the Government presented sufficient evidence to show that Defendant was guilty of the crime or just failed to act.

Held
Reversed and remanded for a new trial.

Discussion
The Court ruled that in order for Defendant to be convicted of murder, the Government would have to show some sort of evidence indicating an agreement between Defendant and Rowe. The Court noted that the Government did not present any evidence that Defendant knew Rowe for a long time, that they were together prior to the crime or that they were together after the crime.
