22 Ill.192 Or. 188, 233 P.2d 786 (1951)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant induced the complaining witness to agree to guarantee his indebtedness to another on a false representation of ownership. Defendant was convicted of obtaining property by false pretenses. The issue revolves around whether or not, under the statutory scheme, this constitutes an allegation a criminal act.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A creditor who orally guarantees to pay the debt of another does not pass title to the debtor.

Facts
Defendant Miller induced the Hub Lumber Company to agree to pay his debt to the Howard Cooper Corporation if he should fail to pay it. Miller told Hub that he owned a tractor free of encumbrance, but he was actually purchasing the tractor under a conditional sales contract. Defendant executed a chattel mortgage to the tractor as security. Thereafter, Defendant was convicted of obtaining property by false pretenses. The issue before the Court is whether the facts presented show that Defendant obtained “any property” within the meaning of the statute upon receiving an oral guarantee to have his debt paid.

Issue
Did the Defendant obtain any property from the Hub Lumber Company when he induced them to agree to pay his indebtedness to the Howard Cooper Corporation if he failed to pay it?

Held
No. Judgment is reversed and the action dismissed.

Discussion
If the indictment had alleged that the Defendant obtained the signature of the company or its agent to a guarantee of his debt, then the issue here would be completely different.
