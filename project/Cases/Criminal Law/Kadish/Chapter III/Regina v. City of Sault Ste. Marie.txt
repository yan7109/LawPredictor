Issue
Are there compelling grounds for the recognition of a third category of offenses in addition to the traditional two: strict liability and fault?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The opinion in this case posits an intermediary category of offences in which the prosecution is not required to prove the existence of mens rea because taking the prohibited action itself is prima facie evidence of the offence. Once it is shown that the prohibited act was taken, the accused has the opportunity to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable care. This case offers insight into the arguments for and against the existence of strict liability offenses and should be read as a discussion and not as a case that sets forth a rule of law.
