Citation
22 Ill.971 F.2d 193 (9th Cir. 1991)

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellants appeal their convictions for interfering with activities of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Office in Arizona and for failing to comply with an order of a federal police officer. The charges arose from their protest activities based on the United States’ involvement in El Salvador. Their appeal stems from the District Court’s denial of a necessity defense.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The defense of necessity is inapplicable to cases involving indirect civil disobedience.

Facts
In December of 1989, thirty people, including the Appellants, entered into the IRS office where they recited the phrase “keep America’s tax dollars out of El Salvador,” threw simulated blood on the office furniture, walls and carpeting and generally interfered with the office’s operation. After a federal police officer ordered the group several times to leave or face arrest, the Appellants were arrested. During the bench trial, the Appellants contended their acts in protest of American involvement in El Salvador were necessary to prevent further fighting in the country.

Issue
Does the defense of necessity apply in cases where indirect civil disobedience is present?

Held
No. The decision of the lower court is affirmed. Judge Boochever delivered the opinion of the court.

Discussion
Indirect protests of congressional policies can never meet all of the requirements under the necessity doctrine. Therefore, the necessity defense is not available in such cases.
