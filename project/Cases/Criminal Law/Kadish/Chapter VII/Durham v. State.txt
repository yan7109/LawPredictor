Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Durham (Defendant) a deputy game warden, was convicted of assault and battery of man suspected of illegal fishing.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An officer may use deadly force if necessary against any suspect physically resisting arrest, even if the subject of the arrest only constitutes a misdemeanor.

Facts
The Defendant, a deputy game warden, attempted to arrest a man suspected of illegal fishing. He pursued the suspect in his boat and latched onto his anchor chain. The suspect resisted arrest by beating the Defendant about the head with an oar. The Defendant then shot the suspect in the arm.

Issue
Can an officer use deadly force against a suspect who is physically resisting arrest, even though the subject of the arrest is a misdemeanor?

Held
Yes. Reversed.

Discussion
Though the court maintains a higher threshold in the use of deadly force for a misdemeanor arrest, as opposed to suspected felony offenses, it still provides for deadly force as a last resort where the suspect actively resists arrest.
