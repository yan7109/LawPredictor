Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Ceballos (Defendant), was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for setting up a gun trap in his garage that fired a bullet at the face of an intruder.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Defense of justification is not applicable where defendant was not even present to be in any way threatened by the invasion of the intruder.

Facts
Having noticed evidence that someone had tried to break into his garage, the Defendant set up a gun trap that would fire a bullet at someone trying to gain entry. A neighborhood kid who hoped to gain entry to the garage to steal certain items was shot in the face by the gun trap when he attempted to enter the garage. The Defendant was not at home at the time of the assault.

Issue
Can a defendant use a defense of justification in assaulting an intruder by use of a gun trap that fired at intruder when defendant was not at home?

Held
No. Affirmed.

Discussion
Under the relevant statute, the Defendant would not have been justified in shooting the intruder himself as he attempted to enter the premises principally because the neighborhood boy did not present an “atrocious” or life-threatening danger to the Defendant and would not have had he in fact been present.
