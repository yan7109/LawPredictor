22 Ill.343 Md. 97, 680 A.2d 512 (1996)

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Smallwood, a knowingly HIV-positive individual (Defendant), was convicted of attempted murder of three rape victims for sexually assaulting them without using a condom.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The mere act of having unprotected sex with another person, knowing that one is HIV positive, is not sufficient to support an inference of an intent to kill.

Facts
The Defendant, a rapist, was convicted of three counts of attempted murder. The state justified the allegation of “intent to murder” on the basis of Defendant’s knowledge that he was HIV positive at the time of the rapes and his failure to use a condom while assaulting his victims.

Issue
Does evidence that a person who knowingly carried the HIV virus sexually assaulted other persons without using a condom sufficiently prove that he intended to kill them?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
This case illustrates limitations upon a prosecution for an attempted crime. Absent any other circumstantial evidence, such as a statement of intent to kill a defendant made during an assault, the act of having unprotected sex with the knowledge that one is HIV positive was not sufficient for the court to draw an inference of intent to kill.
