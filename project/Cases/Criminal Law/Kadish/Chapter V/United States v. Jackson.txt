22 Ill.835 F.2d 1195 (7th Cir. 1987)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant, Jackson, robbed a bank after he was released from prison on a work release program. Jackson had just finished serving two conviction sentences for robbery. He was sentenced to life in prison under a statute which provided that anyone with three previous felony convictions for robbery or burglary (or both) who possesses a firearm shall be imprisoned not less than fifteen years without the possibility of parole. Jackson had been previously convicted of four armed bank robberies and one armed robbery.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The selection of a sentence within the statutory range is free of appellate review.

Facts
About thirty minutes after Defendant, Jackson, was released from prison after serving two bank robbery convictions, he robbed another bank. Jackson had been previously convicted of four armed bank robberies and one armed robbery.

Issue
Was the imposition of life in prison on Jackson permissible?

Held
Yes. Judge Easterbrook delivered the opinion of the court. Defendant agrees that the statute permitted the imposition of any term of years but insists that it allowed only a determinate numbers of years and therefore did not authorize a life sentence. When parole is forbidden, a judge may use either method to reach the same result.

Concurrence
Judge Posner concurring. I agree with the court’s decision, but feel as though the sentence is too extreme. However, the Appellant presents no grounds on which to set aside an excessive sentence.

Discussion
The statute reflects a judgment that career criminals who continue to possess weapons should be dealt with in a severe manner.
