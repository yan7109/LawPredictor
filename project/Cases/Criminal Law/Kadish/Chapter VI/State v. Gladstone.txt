Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Gladstone (Defendant), who offered the name and address of local drug dealer to a prospective buyer, was convicted of aiding and abetting another individual in the unlawful sale of marijuana.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In order to be convicted of having aided and abetted a criminal offense, it must be shown that defendant did something in association or connection with the principal offender to accomplish the crime.

Facts
An individual hired by the local police department went to the Defendant in order to purchase marijuana. The Defendant claimed not to have a sufficient amount to sell to the individual, so he referred him to another drug dealer, giving him the name of the dealer and directions to his location. There was no evidence that the Defendant contacted in any manner the drug dealer regarding the referral.

Issue
Is a person guilty of aiding and abetting a criminal offense if he does not purposefully act in association with the principal offender to accomplish the crime?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Dissent
When the Defendant referred the buyer to another marijuana dealer he thereby showed the requisite intent that his action would instigate or induce that dealer to commit a crime.

Discussion
This case emphasizes the requirement of establishing a nexus between the party that aids and abets an offense and the principal offender. The court notes that the Defendant was convicted of aiding and abetting a dealer in the crime of selling drugs. His conviction was not for giving assistance to the prospective buyer, where the state’s case might arguably have been stronger on the one point of establishing a nexus.
