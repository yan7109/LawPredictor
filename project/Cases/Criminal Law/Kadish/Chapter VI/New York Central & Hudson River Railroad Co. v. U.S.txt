The Defendant corporation, New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Co.

Specifically, the corporation was prosecuted for the payment of rebates to the American Sugar Refining Company arising out of shipments of sugar from New York to Detroit.

Issue
Is a corporation criminally responsible for the unlawful acts of its agent acting within the scope of authority conferred upon them by the corporation?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
This important case took away the immunity from criminal prosecution that corporations previously enjoyed. The court’s reasoning was that insomuch as the corporation could be imputed with the knowledge of the actions its employees were taking in the course of their employment, any criminal culpability for those actions – should they be in violation of law – could also be imputed to the corporation.
