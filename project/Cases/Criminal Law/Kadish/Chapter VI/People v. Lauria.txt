22 Ill.251 Cal.App.2d 471, 59 Cal.Rptr. 628 (Ct. App. 1967)

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Lauria (Defendant), operated an answering service and knew that some of his customers were prostitutes who used the service to pick up calls from potential clients.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A supplier becomes part of a criminal conspiracy when, knowing that his goods are being used for unlawful purposes, there is direct evidence that he intends to participate in the furtherance of the crime, or where an inference of intent can be drawn through either (a) his special interest in the activity or (b) the aggravated nature of the crime itself.

Facts
The Defendant maintained an answering service. Among his customers were at least three prostitutes who used the service to pick up calls for their unlawful activities. The Defendant admitted to knowing that prostitutes used his answering service for business purposes. He was indicted, together with three prostitutes, for conspiracy to commit prostitution, a misdemeanor.

Issue
Is a supplier criminally liable for the unlawful acts of his customers whom he knows use his services to advance an unlawful enterprise?

Held
Yes. Affirmed.

Discussion
Here, the court makes clear that a supplier’s knowledge that his services are being used for a criminal purpose is not, by itself, evidence that he was part of a conspiracy to further the criminal purpose.
