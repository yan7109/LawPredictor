22 Ill.4 Wn. App. 899, 484 P.2d 1162 (Ct. App. 1971)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendants Walter and Bernice Williams were found guilty of manslaughter for negligently failing to supply their infant child with necessary medical attention, as a result of which the child died. The basis of the conviction was ordinary negligence.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under the penal code of Washington, ordinary negligence is sufficient to support a manslaughter conviction.

Facts
Defendants were aware that their son was ill during the two-week period beginning September 1, 1968, however they did not realize the extent of the child’s illness and as a result, failed to seek medical attention for the child. The child died and Defendants were charged and convicted of manslaughter. The basis of the conviction was ordinary negligence. The defendants appeal.

Issue
Was there sufficient evidence from which the Court could find that a reasonable person under similar conditions would have been sufficiently put on notice concerning the severity of the child’s medical condition such that failure to seek medical care constituted a breach of duty?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
At common law, more than ordinary negligence must be shown in order to support a conviction for criminal manslaughter. A manslaughter conviction under the Washington statute as it was written at the time of this case required only that ordinary negligence is the proximate cause of the victim’s death. That statute has since been repealed.
