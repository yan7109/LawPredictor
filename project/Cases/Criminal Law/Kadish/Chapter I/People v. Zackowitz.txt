Brief Fact Summary
Zackowitz (D) was convicted of first degree murder for shooting a man who made a lewd comment to his wife.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In a criminal prosecution, character is never an issue unless the defendant chooses to make it one.

Facts
As Zackowitz’s wife was passing by four men in Brooklyn, Coppola (victim) made an insulting comment to her. Zackowitz, (D) seeing his wife in tears, berated the men with offensive language. He had been drinking prior to this confrontation. Zackowitz and his wife returned to their apartment where the wife told him Coppola had asked her to “lie with her and offered her two dollars.” Enraged by this, Zackowitz approached the four men once again. Words and blows were exchanged and Coppola came at Zackowitz with a wrench. Zackowitz then shot Coppola.

Issue
Whether the defendant’s state of mind at the moment he shot Coppola was deliberate and premeditated or whether he was driven by impulsive rage.

Held
This court believes evidence was prejudiced against the defendant and thus the judgment be reversed and a new trial ordered.

Dissent
The defendant was not presented to jury as one having a “dangerous disposition” but rather as someone who had the opportunity to carry out his threats with a weapon and did so.

Discussion
When evidence of the defendant’s bad character is brought first by the prosecution, it is likely to prejudice the jury and therefore it is illegal to bring such evidence to prove the state of mind of the defendant.
