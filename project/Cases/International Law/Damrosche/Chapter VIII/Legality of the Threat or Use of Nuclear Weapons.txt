Held
Yes. At the request of whatever body which may be authorized by or in accordance with the charter of the United Nations to make such a request, the International Court of Justice may give an advisory opinion on any legal question.

Discussion
The argument that the Court should not be involved in rendering advisory opinion on the basis that such a reply might negatively affect disarmament negotiation was rejected by the Court. The Court also rejected the arguments that it would be exceeding its authority and acting in a law-making capacity. The reason why the Court did not concur with this later argument was that it simply stated the existing law and does not legislate, even if it must at times specify the application and extent of such law.
