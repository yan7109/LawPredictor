Synopsis of Rule of Law

Facts
The claim of Alvarez (P) was that the bounty hunters who brought him to the United States detained him against his will.

Issue
Is international law part of the U.S. law?

Held
(Souter, J.) yes. International is part of U.S. law.  The first principal element of the law of nations covers the general norms regarding the relationship of nation states, which is the purview of the Executive and Legislative Branches of government. The second principal element of the law of nations falls within the judiciary, which is a body of judge-made law regulating the conduct of individuals situated outside domestic boundaries.

Discussion
A seminal case for the concept that international law is part of U.S. domestic law is excerpted by this short case and that international norms may be considered in determining individual rights in federal cases.
