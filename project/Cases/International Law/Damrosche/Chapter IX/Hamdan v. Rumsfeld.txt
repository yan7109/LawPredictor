Brief Fact Summary
After Hamdan (P) was captured in Afghanistan, a U.S. military commission began proceedings against him. The authority of the commission was challenged by Hamdan (P).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The congress or the inherent powers of the President did not authorize the military commission established to try those deemed “enemy combatants” for alleged war crimes in the War on Terror.

Facts
Afghan forces captured Salim Ahmed Hamdan (P) and the U.S. military imprisoned him at Guantanamo Bay. He challenged his imprisonment by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court but before the court could rule on the petition, a U.S. military commission began proceeding and named Hamdan (P) an enemy combatant. Hamdan (P) challenged the authority of the commission on the ground that the commission trial would violate his rights under Article 102 of the Geneva Convention, which provides that a “prisoner of war can be validly sentenced only if the sentence has been pronounced by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power”.

Issue
Did the congress or the inherent powers of the President authorize the military commission established to try enemy combatants for alleged war crimes in the War on Terror?

Held
No. The congress or the inherent powers of the President did not authorize the military commission established to try those deemed “enemy combatants” for alleged war crimes in the War on Terror. Absent that express authorization, the commission had to comply with the ordinary laws of the United States (D) and the laws of war.

Discussion
Many U.S. and international human rights organizations have determined that violations might occur through the non-application of the Geneva Convention to detainees in the U.S. war on terrorism.
