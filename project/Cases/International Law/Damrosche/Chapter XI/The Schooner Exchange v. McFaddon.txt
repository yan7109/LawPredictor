Brief Fact Summary
Two Americans (P) laid claims of ownership and entitlements to the schooner Exchange.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
National ships of war are viewed as been exempted by consent of the power of the friendly jurisdiction whose port the ship enters.

Facts
Two Americans (P) claimed they owned and were entitled to the schooner Exchange they seized on the high seas.  The claim which the United States Attorney (D) put forward for the prevention of the ship leaving was that, the ship which was owned by the Emperor of France had been forced to enter the port of Philadelphia due to bad weather conditions.

Issue
Are National ships of war viewed as been exempted by the consent of the power of the friendly jurisdiction whose port the ship enters?

Held
(Marshall, C.J.) Yes. National ships of war are viewed as been exempted by consent of the power of the friendly jurisdiction whose port the ship enters. A nation’s jurisdiction within its sovereign territory is exclusive and absolute.

Discussion
The absolute form of sovereign immunity from judicial jurisdiction was implicated in this case. Three principles were brought forward by the court in this case; the immunity that all civilized nations allow to foreign ministers; the exemption of the person of the sovereign from arrest or imprisonment within a foreign country; and when a sovereign permits troops of a foreign prince to pass through his territory, such sovereign is understood to mean he has ceded a portion of his territorial jurisdiction.
