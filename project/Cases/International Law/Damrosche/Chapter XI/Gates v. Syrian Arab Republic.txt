Facts
Two U.S. contractors named Armstrong and Hensley were beheaded by the al-Qaeda in Iraq. The loss of these men prompted their families to file charges against the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria) (D), its president (D) and its intelligence minister (D). The families also sought damages under the FSIA and asserted state-law claims for battery, assault, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, wrongful death, survival damages, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting.

Issue
(1) in a situation where the plaintiffs asserts that they are victims of state sponsored terrorism; should state-law claims be dismissed?

Held
(Judge not stated in casebook excerpt)

Discussion
The damages provision S 1605A (c) which was enacted in 2008 in an effort by Congress to assist victims in satisfying their judgments against state sponsors of terrorism contained the damages which the court used to award various money damages in this case. The provision also removes all forms of ambiguity on the applicability of a cause of action provided in the terrorist-state exception to agents, employees or officials of the state sponsor and to the state itself.
