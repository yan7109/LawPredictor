45 Cal. 2d 213,288 P.2d 267,1955 Cal.

Brief Fact Summary
Respondents are requesting that Petitioner’s law firm be disqualified from its representation of Petitioner on the grounds that the firm was previously retained to represent the corporation that Respondent managed as an officer.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Corporate counsel’s duty to the corporation does not specifically extend to any of its officers or managers. Counsel has a duty to act in the best interests of the corporation, even if these actions may conflict with the best interests of individual officers.

Facts
Respondent, former chairman of the Rhode Island Insurance Company, was charged with breach of his fiduciary duty to Petitioners, filing on behalf of the creditors, policyholders, and stockholders of the company. Respondent is attempting to have the Providence firm Edwards and Angell disqualified from further participation in the case, arguing that they had a “dual relationship” to himself and the corporation.

Issue
Was there an attorney-client relationship between Respondent and the law firm? When an attorney represents a corporation dominated by an officer whose personal interests are strongly tied to the company, does an attorney-client relationship exist to the degree that the law firm may not represent the company in a suit against the officer?

Held
No. No disqualification.

Discussion
Corporate counsel must always represent the best interests of the corporation, even if these interests directly conflict with its officers.
