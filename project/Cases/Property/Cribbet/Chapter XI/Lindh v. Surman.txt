Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff sued the Defendant to recover an engagement ring, or its value, after the engagement was broken.

Then, in 1994, Plaintiff again called off the engagement and asked for the ring back. Defendant refused to return the ring and the Plaintiff filed this lawsuit. The case was presented to arbitration, where the Defendant prevailed. Plaintiff appealed the arbitrator’s decision to a trial court where the non-jury trial resulted in a verdict for Plaintiff in the amount of $21,200. Defendant appealed to the intermediate appellate court which affirmed the decision of the trial court
