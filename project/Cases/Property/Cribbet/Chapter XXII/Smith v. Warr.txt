Citation
22 Ill.564 P.2d 771 (Utah 1977)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff contracted to buy property from Defendant. The contract provided that special warranty deed was to be passed upon full payment, but before that event occurred, Defendant was sued for adverse possession of the property and lost to the third party adverse possessors.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This court held that the measure of damages where the vendor has breached a land sale contract is the market value of the property at the time of the breach less the contract price to the vendee.

Facts
Plaintiff, a buyer of property according to Uniform Real Estate Contracts, contracted to buy property from Defendant. The contract provided that special warranty deed was to be passed upon full payment, but before that event occurred, Defendant seller was sued for adverse possession of the property in question, which Defendant lost to the third party adverse possessors. Plaintiff was thereafter awarded damages of only out-of-pocket loss and both attorneys’ fees and costs were denied. The Plaintiff is appealing, claiming that the lower court erred by not awarding benefit of the bargain damages (which is the market value of the property at the time of breach less the amount of unpaid purchase money, where some of the purchase money had been paid.)

Issue
Is the buyer entitled to benefit of the bargain damages due to the seller’s breach?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
As the court points out that there is a split of authority on this question, one must be careful to determine the rule of the jurisdiction should a similar case ever arise. The rule announced by this court is rather broad and would apparently apply against a buyer as well as a seller.
