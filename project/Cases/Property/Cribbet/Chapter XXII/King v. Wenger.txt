22 Ill.219 Kan. 668, 549 P.2d 986 (1976)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff sued Defendant for specific performance based on a handwritten agreement.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The fact that the parties contemplate the execution of a formal document is evidence that they intend to not be bound until the execution of the formal contract.

Therefore, the court would not conclude that the parties intended to be bound. This is not a case for part performance, because the Plaintiff did nothing until the property had been sold to someone else.
