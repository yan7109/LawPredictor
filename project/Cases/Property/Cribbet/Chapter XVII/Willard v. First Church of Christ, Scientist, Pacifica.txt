Brief Fact Summary
This case involves a dispute, in which, a church utilized a lot for parking, and this use was reserved in the deed, however, when it was conveyed to a third person, it did not contain the express reservation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The court will look to the intent of the grantor in determining whether a conveyance contains an easement to a third party.

Facts
McGuigan owned two lots abutting one another known as lots 19 and 20, which were situated across the street from the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Pacifica (Defendant). McGuigan allowed the church to use lot 20 for parking during church services; lot 19 had a building on it. McGuigan sold lot 19 to Peterson, who used the building thereon for an office. Peterson wished to resell the lot so he listed lot 19 with a realtor, Willard (Plaintiff). Plaintiff wished to purchase lot 19 and lot 20, so he and Peterson signed a deposit receipt for both lots. Peterson approached McGuigan about purchasing lot 20, so that he could sell it to Plaintiff. McGuigan was willing to sell the lot so long as the church could continue to use the lot for parking. The church’s attorney wrote a restriction clause into the deed from McGuigan to Peterson, which stated that the conveyance was subject to an easement for parking to benefit the church and that the easement was to run with the land so long
