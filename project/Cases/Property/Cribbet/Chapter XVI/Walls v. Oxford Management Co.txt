Facts
On December 5, 1988, Plaintiff Deanna Walls was sexually assaulted in her vehicle parked on the premises of Bay Ridge Apartment Complex. The Defendants in this case are the owners of the apartment complex and the management of the complex. During the two years prior to the assault on Plaintiff there were eleven auto thefts, three attempted auto thefts, and thirty-one incidents of criminal mischief/ theft. No sexual assaults were reported. Plaintiff brought an action in federal court alleging that Defendants had a duty to hire competent management, provide reasonable security, a duty to warn residents of lack of security, and a duty to warn residents of the numerous criminal activities which had occurred. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendants breached the duties listed and that such breach was the proximate cause of her injuries.
