Issue
What is the proper measure of damages for a breach of a covenant of warranty in a deed?

Held
At common law, the measure of recovery was the value of land at the time the warranty was made.

Discussion
The Court noted in its decision that there could be extreme cases where this rule would have a harsh result. Such an example is where the vendee has undertaken to make improvements on the land and is evicted by a paramount title holder. The recovery is limited to the purchase price of the land under the contract, along with interest.
