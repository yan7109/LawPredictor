Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiffs entered into a land purchase agreement with the Defendants for sale of property to be paid in monthly installments to the Plaintiffs. Defendants defaulted and Plaintiffs sued for possession.

The Defendants did default on the contract and the Plaintiffs filed this suit seeking ejectment of the Defendants. The trial court granted summary judgment for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants appealed.
