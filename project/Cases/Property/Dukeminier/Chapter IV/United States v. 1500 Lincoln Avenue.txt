949 F.2d 73 (3d Cir. 1991)

Brief Fact Summary
The Government sued to determine whether the innocent spouse possessed rights in property held by tenancy by the entirety. One spouse violated a federal statute that allowed the government to force forfeiture of property held by an individual who violated the statute.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
To preserve the goals of the statute, the innocent spouse has rights of survivorship and this prevents attachment by the guilty spouse’s creditors.

Facts
In 1989, the United States filed suit seeking civil forfeiture of property held by husband and wife in tenancy by the entirety. The government alleged that the Mr. Bernstein, the owner had used the property for illegal purposes. Mrs. Bernstein alleged an “innocent owner” defense and argued that because the property was held in tenancy by the entirety, she was entitled to keep the property. The district court held that the United States was not entitled to forfeiture of any interest in the property.

Issue
Whether the interest of one spouse in real property, held in tenancy of the entirety is divisible or must be forfeited if the other spouse violates a statute requiring forfeiture of the property.

Held
Reversed and remanded to the trial court. The trial court must determine whether the guilty spouse’s interest is subject to forfeiture, but also must preserve the innocent spouse’s right to exclusive use and protection against conveyance.

Discussion
The court started by analyzing the statute and stating that it was susceptible to opposite interpretations when it came to tenancy by the entirety. The court decided on an interpretation they felt preserved the two goals of the statute as well as the established legal principles of tenancy by the entirety.
