Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioners, Mrs. Soules and Housing Opportunities Made Equal, Inc. (Petitioners), brought this suit against the Respondents, the United States Department of Housing & Urban Development (Respondents), asking the court to overturn a ruling by an Administrative Law Judge who dismissed discrimination claims under sections 3604(a) and (c) of the Fair Housing Act (the Act).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Administrative Law Judges decision was supported by a substantial amount of the evidence, which is the standard of review for this appeal.

Facts
Mrs. Soules attempted to lease an apartment from a realty company. Pursuant to a New York law requiring separate bedrooms for children of different gender over five, the realty company inquired about the age and number of children that would occupy the apartment. However, the reason the realty company gave to Mrs. Soules for the inquiry was that there was an elderly lady living above the apartment concerned about noise. Eventually the apartment in question was rented to someone with no children. The Petitioners sued under the Act. The Administrative Law Judge found no violations of the Act and the Petitioners appealed for review.
