Brief Fact Summary

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages by attempting to re-let an apartment vacated by a tenant at fair market value.

Facts
The Defendant, Kridel (Defendant) signed a two-year lease for an apartment owned by the Plaintiff, Sommer (Plaintiff). The Defendant paid the security deposit and first month’s rent. Prior to even obtaining the keys to the apartment, the Defendant broke off his engagement, became a student and attempted to terminate the lease by letter to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff did not attempt to re-let the apartment until months later. Plaintiff sued the Defendant for the full amount due under the two-year lease. The trial court found that the Plaintiff had a duty to mitigate by attempting to re-let the premises. The appellate court reversed and the Defendant appealed.

Held
Reversed, a landlord does have an obligation to make a reasonable effort to mitigate damages in this situation for the following reasons:

Discussion
The court overruled precedent based on the theory that when the landlord signed the lease with a tenant, the landlord may not interfere with the estate granted to the tenant by the lease. The court noted that a lease for residential property could no longer be distinguished from an ordinary contract and thus was subject to the contract rule requiring mitigation of damages.
