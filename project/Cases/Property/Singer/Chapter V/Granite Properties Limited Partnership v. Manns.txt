117 Ill. 2d 425, 512 N.E.2d 1230, 1987 Ill. 111 Ill. Dec. 593.

Brief Fact Summary
The landowners of two adjoining tracts of land dispute the use of two driveways that exist on one of the properties.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An easement implied from a preexisting use is established by three elements: (1) common ownership of the claimed dominant and servient parcels and a subsequent conveyance or transfer separating that ownership; (2) before the conveyance or transfer severing the unity of title, the common owner used part of the united parcel for the benefit of another part, and this use was apparent and obvious, continuous, and permanent; (3) the claimed easement is necessary and beneficial to the enjoyment of the parcel conveyed or retained by the grantor or transferor.

Facts
At one point, Granite Properties (Plaintiff) owned all the properties in question. Parcel B was conveyed to Larry and Ann Manns (Defendant) by warranty deed. Plaintiff currently owns Parcels A and E. Parcel A is a shopping center and Parcel E has an apartment complex on it. Both A and E were developed prior to the sale of Parcel B. To gain access to the shopping center to make large deliveries, vehicles use a driveway on Parcel B, which is the first claimed easement. The other claimed easement is a driveway that cuts over Parcel B to the apartment complex on Parcel E. Defendant was aware of the two driveways at the time of purchase.

Issue
After real property has been sold, can the original owner continue to use a portion of the sold property, even if there is no express contract to create an easement?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
An implied easement effectuates the intent of the parties that was never written down. For easements implied from prior use, absolute necessity is not required for the easement to be recognized.
