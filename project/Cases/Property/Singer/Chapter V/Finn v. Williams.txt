Brief Fact Summary
Over many years, owners of a parcel land use a road on another’s land to get to a public highway. The road is closed by the owner.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An easement by necessity may be given to an owner of a landlocked parcel over another person’s land in order for the owner to gain access to his land.

Facts
Charles Williams owned a large parcel of land. He conveyed a portion of it to Thomas Bacon. The rest was inherited by Zilphia Jane Williams (Defendant). The Finns (Plaintiff) bought the land belonging to Bacon. The only way for Plaintiff to get to a public road is by using a road through Defendant’s land because the only other available private road was closed. Plaintiff requests an easement by necessity over Defendant’s land.

Issue
If the original landowner did not claim a right of way over an area of land before any sort of conveyance was made, can a claim for an easement by necessity still be made?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Buyers will not buy property unless they have guaranteed access to it by an easement over a neighboring land. Granting access effectuates the intent of the parties.
