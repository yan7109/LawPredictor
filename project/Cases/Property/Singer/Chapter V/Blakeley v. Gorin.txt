365 Mass. 590, 313 N.E.2d 903, 1974 Mass.

Brief Fact Summary
The state has a land use plan with old restrictions that are now impeding development.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a restrictive covenant would impede the reasonable use of land, it will not be enforced.

Facts
Petitioners own two parcels land separated by an alley. One lot is vacant; the other is the site of a hotel. They plan to build a structure on the vacant lot and will connect it to the hotel by a bridge over the alley. Respondents own a parcel of land adjacent to the vacant lot and which backs the same alley. The land has apartments, and the rear apartments derive their light and air from windows that face the alley. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts created restrictions in 1850, and among them was the requirement of keeping a passageway open in the area that is now the alley. PA statute states that no restriction shall be enforced unless the restriction is of actual and substantial benefit to the person claiming the right of enforcement. Petitioners claim the restriction is obsolete and unenforceable.

Issue
If the reasonable use of land is being prevented by a restriction, must the restriction be reasonably enforced?

Held
No.

Dissent
The area has not undergone a drastic change. It still remains largely residential. The proposed building would be an unnecessarily large intrusion into the area, so Respondent should be allowed specific performance of the restriction.

Discussion
If equity favors not enforcing a restriction, courts will not order specific performance but instead order money damages for the complaining party.
