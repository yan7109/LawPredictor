Brief Fact Summary
A restaurant wanted to sell alcohol in a community that has restrictive covenants prohibiting the sale of alcohol.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When the character of a community drastically changes, restrictive covenants may no longer be enforced if the enforcement will not benefit the community.

Facts
El Di, Inc. (Defendant) is a restaurant on a beach that has applied for a license to sell alcoholic beverages because of public demand. The surrounding town (Plaintiffs) used to be a quiet beach community. When it was originally formed, restrictive covenants were made on plots which prohibited the sale of alcohol because the creators wanted the area to be a quiet community. Over the years, the town has become much larger and more commercial. Defendant’s patrons may carry their own alcohol into the restaurant without violating any covenants.

Issue
If a restrictive covenant no longer benefits a parcel of land, must it still be enforced?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Dissent
The beach remains a quiet, family-oriented resort. The conditions of the community are still consistent with the enforcement of a restrictive covenant which forbids the sale of alcohol. Those who choose to buy land with restrictions should abide by those restrictions.
