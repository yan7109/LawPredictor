378 Mass. 85, 390 N.E.2d 243, 1979 Mass.

Brief Fact Summary
A parcel of land was sold with the restriction that it could not be used for a discount store. The deed said the restriction ran with the land.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Reasonable covenants to compete may be considered to run with the land when they serve a purpose of facilitating orderly and harmonious development for commercial use.

Facts
Charles Kosteas (Defendant) sells a parcel A to trustees of the 122 Trust (Trust). The deed had numerous restrictions, including one that restricted Defendant from using the abutting land for a discount store that would compete with the discount store Trust intended to build. Defendant was allowed to build a drug store on his retained land. The deed states that the restrictions are covenants running with the land. Trust conveys parcel A to Whitinsville Plaza (Plaintiff). The deed to Plaintiff expressly made Plaza subject to, and gave it the benefit of, the restrictions in Defendant’s deed. Defendant leases its abutting land to CVS for use as a discount department store and pharmacy. Plaintiff sues to enjoin Defendant and CVS from operating a discount store.

Issue
Does a non-competition clause in a deed that puts restrictions on the grantor touch and concern the land?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
In a commercial lease, reasonable anticompetitive covenants are enforceable by and against successors to the original parties.
