206 Cal. App. 3d 1376, 254 Cal. Rptr. 179, 1988 Cal. App.

Brief Fact Summary
A lease did not fix the amount of rent to be paid each month, but instead determined it to be based on a percent of deliveries. The lessee stopped operating before the lease ended, and so only paid a minimal amount of rent.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A covenant of continued operation in good faith will be implied into commercial leases containing percentage rental provisions if the minimum rent is not substantial.

Facts
The College Block (Plaintiff) leased real property to Atlantic Richfield Company (Defendant) for 20 years. Defendant agreed to build and operate a gas station on the property. The rent was determined by a percentage of the gasoline delivered, and irrespective of the gallons delivered, Plaintiff was to receive a minimum of $1000 each month. Thirty-nine months before the lease was to expire, Defendant closed the station and paid Plaintiff the $1000.00 each month for the months remaining on the lease. The lease did not contain an express covenant requiring it to operate the station; Plaintiff claims that the covenant is implied.

Issue
Does an implied covenant of continued operation arise when a lease does not fix rent, but guarantees a percentage based upon deliveries?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
If the base rent is small, a court will usually find an implied covenant to operate a business continuously.
