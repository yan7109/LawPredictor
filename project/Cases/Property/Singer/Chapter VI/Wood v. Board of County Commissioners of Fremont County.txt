759 P.2d 1250,1988 Wyo.

Brief Fact Summary
A couple deeded land to be used as a hospital. When it stopped being used as a hospital, they attempted to reclaim the land.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There is a presumption that every conveyance of real estate passes all the estate of the grantor unless the intent to pass less is expressly stated or is necessarily implied in the terms of the grant.

Facts
Cecil and Edna Wood (Appellants) conveyed land to Fremont County by warranty deed for the construction of a county hospital. The county built a hospital and operated it. They then sold the hospital to a private company, that later moved the operation and put the premises up for sale. Appellants now contend that the language of the deed created either a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent with a right of reversion if the land ceased to be used as a hospital.

Issue
When a conveyance is ambiguous and the intent of the grantor is unclear, is a presumption against the existence of a future interest valid?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
When the intent of a grantor is unclear, courts will attempt further the alienability of property by presuming against the existence of a future interest.
