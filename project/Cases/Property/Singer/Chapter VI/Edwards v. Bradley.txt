227 Va. 224,315 S.E.2d 196, 1984 Va.

Brief Fact Summary
A woman was left a farm, but a dispute arose as to whether it was left in fee simple or as a life estate.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If a will does not explicitly leave a life estate in property, the creation of a life estate can be implied from the intent of the testator.

Facts
A will devised a farm to Margaret Edwards (Defendant), conditioned upon her keeping the farm free from encumbrances. If it ever became encumbered or creditors attempted to subject the farm to payment of Defendant’s debts, her interest would cease and become vested in her children. Defendant attempted to sell the farm, but one of her children, Beverley Bradley (Plaintiff), refused to let it be sold. Upon Defendant’s death, Defendant directed by will that the farm be sold and proceeds be distributed equally amongst her other children. Plaintiff alleges that the original will created a life estate in Defendant and a remainder to the children. Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the sale or encumbrance of the farm without Defendant’s consent.

Issue
If the will does not explicitly leave a life estate in property, can the creation of a life estate be implied from the intent of the testator?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
A life estate can be created by implication if the language of the will can show the testator intended to create such an estate. A life estate owner has no right to determine who owns the property after her death.
