Brief Fact Summary
A franchisor of a gas station ended a lease with a franchisee in order to sell the property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A franchisor who in good faith and for a bona fide reason terminates, cancels, or fails to renew a franchise for any reason other than the franchisee’s substantial breach of its obligations has violated the law and is liable to the franchisee for the reasonable value of the business less the amount realizable on liquidation.

Facts
Cities Service Oil Co. (Defendant) owned land on which a gas station was located. James Galligan, who had worked as an attendant at the station for 20 years, organized Westfield Centre Service, Inc. (Plaintiff) to purchase the business. The seller was a lessee-franchisee of Defendant, marketing the gasoline under the name of Citgo. In conjunction with the purchase, Plaintiff entered into several agreements with Defendant, including a station lease of the property and improvements. Defendant decided to sell the station property and notified Plaintiff that the lease would not be renewed. Plaintiffs seek an order enjoining Defendant from proceeding with the sale and from interfering with Plaintiff’s use of the property.

Issue
Can a franchisor sever the relationship with its franchisee only with good cause?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
A franchisee has the right to an injunction to prevent the termination of his lease if there is no good reason to end it.”
