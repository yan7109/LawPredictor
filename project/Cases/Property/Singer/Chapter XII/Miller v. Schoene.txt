Brief Fact Summary
Cedar trees were about to infect an apple orchard with a disease, so the state ordered the trees destroyed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The public interest outweighs the property interest of the individual, and the state may use its police power to preserve the public interest, even if that means property must be destroyed.

Facts
The state entomologist (Defendant) ordered Plaintiffs to cut down a large number of ornamental red cedar trees growing on their property, in order to prevent the spread of a rust or plant disease to the apple orchards in the vicinity. A statute requires the state entomologist to discover infected trees and direct the owner to destroy them.

Issue
When two classes property exist in dangerous proximity, may the state choose to preserve one, which is of greater value to the public over the other?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The state can take and destroy private property if doing so would be in the best interests of the public, including the public economic interest. Their authority derives from the police power given to states.
