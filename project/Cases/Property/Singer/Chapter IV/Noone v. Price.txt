Brief Fact Summary
A couple discovered their house was slipping down a hill and believed the slipping was caused by an adjacent landowner’s deteriorated retaining wall.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A landowner is entitled to receive lateral support, which is support from adjoining soil, of his land in its natural state.

Facts
The plaintiffs purchased a house, and after a few years, they discovered their house was slipping down a hill. The defendant lived below the plaintiffs at the foot of the hill. The defendant’s property included a retaining wall along the side of the hill, but the wall had fallen into disrepair. The plaintiffs allege the wall was constructed to provide lateral support for their house, and that the disrepair damaged their property. The defendant denies that the condition of her wall caused the damage, and argues that the plaintiffs should have protected their own property.

Issue
Does an adjoining landowner have liability when his lateral support of land is sufficient to hold his neighbor’s land in its natural state, but insufficient to support the additional weight of a building?

Held
No.

Discussion
The absolute right to lateral support of land exists only as to land in its natural state. If a landowner constructs a building, and the soil begins to subside because of the adjacent owner’s acts and the weight of the building, the landowner will not have a claim against the adjacent owner, assuming the adjacent owner is not negligent.
