Brief Fact Summary
An at-will employee was discharged after she was unable to work extended hours because of her child-care responsibilities.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An employer will not be liable to a discharged at-will employee when that employee was let go for being unable to work long hours because of domestic responsibilities.

Facts
Joanna Upton (Plaintiff) is a single mother who was an at-will employee for JWP Businessland, Inc. (Defendant). Defendant wanted her to work long hours, but doing so prevented Plaintiff from spending time with her young son. Plaintiff informed Defendant that she would not be able to continue working the long hours, and she was discharged two weeks later. Plaintiff claims that her discharge was contrary to public policy, and she seeks damages from Defendant.

Issue
Can a wrongful discharge claim be instituted by an at-will employee against an employer because the former employee cannot work the required late hours?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
At-will employment can be ended by the employer for any or no reason, as long as a clearly established public policy is not violated. Child-care is not considered a public policy reason to prevent discharge.
