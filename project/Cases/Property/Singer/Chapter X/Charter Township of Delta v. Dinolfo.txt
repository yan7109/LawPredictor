419 Mich. 253, 351 N.W.2d 831, 1984 Mich.

Brief Fact Summary
Households included more than two unrelated adults, in violation of a city ordinance.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An ordinance, which assigns a number to how many unrelated people can live together is not rationally related to a government interest, and so will be invalid.

Facts
Two households (Defendants) consisted of a husband and wife, that couple’s children, and six unrelated single adults. Defendants act as a family in the home. They have adopted their lifestyle as a means of living out their commitment to Christianity. Their homes are located in an area, which allows for single-family dwellings. They were cited for violating the zoning ordinance because they had more than one unrelated individual residing in their homes. Defendants argue the ordinance impairs their fundamental rights of privacy, association, and free exercise of religion under the United States and Michigan Constitutions.

Issue
Is a zoning ordinance, which restricts those included in the definition of family reasonably related to the goal of preserving traditional family values?

Held
No.

Discussion
The Michigan court gives a greater protection to nontraditional families’ access to real property than does the United States Constitution.
