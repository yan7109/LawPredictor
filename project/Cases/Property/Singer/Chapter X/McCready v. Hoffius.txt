459 Mich. 1235, 593 N.W.2d 545, 1999 Mich.

Brief Fact Summary
An unmarried couple was not allowed to rent an apartment because cohabitating violated the religious beliefs of the landlord.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Civil Rights Act (Act) prohibits discrimination based on marital status in real estate transactions. Marital status is defined in the context of the presence or absence of marriage.

Facts
John and Terry Hoffius (Defendants) owned property, which they rented. Kristal McCready and Keith Kerr (Plaintiffs) answered an advertisement about the property, but Defendants refused to rent it to them when they learned Plaintiffs were single but intended to live together. Defendants explained that unmarried couples living together violated his religious beliefs. Plaintiffs filed a complaint with the city’s fair housing commission.

Issue
Is the cohabitation of married couples on rental properties protected by the Civil Rights Act?

Held
Yes.

Dissent
(Justice Patricia J. Boyle) Marital status refers to the status of being married. So, the term marital status does not encompass the status of being an unmarried cohabitating couple. The state’s public policy refutes the claim that the legislature intends to guarantee housing to individuals who choose to cohabit.<br />

Discussion
The court notes that cohabitating and the lewd behavior statute are two separate ideas, and the former will get protection under anti-discrimination laws. In our society, many couples live together without being married, and the court seems to be responding to modern trends.
