866 F.2d 1276,1989 U.S. App.734.

Brief Fact Summary
A black woman attempted to rent an apartment, but was denied.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Fair Housing Act (Act) prohibits discrimination based on race. Plaintiff must present a prima facie case of discrimination. Then, Defendant must produce evidence that the refusal to rent or negotiate for a rental was motivated by non-racial considerations. Third, if Defendant can give non-discriminatory reasons, Plaintiff must show the proffered reasons were pretextual.

Facts
Rosalyn Asbury (Plaintiff), a black woman, went to an apartment complex and tried to rent an apartment. The manager of Broughham Estates (Defendant) told her there were no vacancies and that she did not keep a waiting list. Defendant would not let her fill out an application or view model units, but suggested that she look at a complex that housed mostly black families. Plaintiff’s income was sufficient to pay rent on Defendant’s apartment. When white customers inquired about units, they were told that units were available. Defendant rented units to whites after Plaintiff was told nothing was available. Plaintiff brought suit under the Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race.

Issue
When a landlord refuses to lease an apartment to a member of a protected class, may that landlord be found to be in violation of a statute that bans discrimination in housing based on race?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The Fair Housing Act is an attempt to prevent racial discrimination in housing. The shifting burdens of proof give both parties a chance to explain their reasoning and motives for their actions.
