Brief Fact Summary
A landlord refused to rent to homosexuals, fearing that they might become infected with AIDS.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
People with AIDS qualify as handicapped, so discrimination against them based on their handicap will be a violation of anti-discrimination laws.

Facts
A property owner refused to rent to three homosexual males because he feared that they would later be infected with AIDS. The owner now faces a claim that he violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination.

Issue
Is refusing to rent to homosexuals because they may one day get AIDS discrimination?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
AIDS is a severe disease, which this court considers to be a handicap. The handicapped, and those perceived to be handicapped, will be protected from discrimination when they try to rent property.
