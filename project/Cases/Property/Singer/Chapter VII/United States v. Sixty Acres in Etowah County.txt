930 F.2d 857,1991 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
An abused wife faced a forfeiture proceeding because of her husband’s drug activities.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A generalized fear of persecution, which does not amount to duress, will not be considered lack of consent to illegal activities to stop forfeiture.

Facts
Evelyn Ellis owned property on which she lived with her husband, Hubert Owen Ellis. Mr. Ellis used drugs and was convicted of selling drugs on the property. His wife was afraid of him because of his previous acts of violence, including the murder of his previous wife. The government sought forfeiture of the property under a statute that provided for civil forfeiture of real property to the federal government if the property is used to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, an illegal drug transaction unless the owner did not know or consent to the illegal activity.

Issue
If a person has a generalized fear of persecution, will that be sufficient to evidence lack of consent to illegal activities?

Held
No.

Discussion
Domestic violence, with nothing else, will not be enough to prove lack of consent to narcotics crime. The abused spouse will lose her home unless she can meet the standard for dure
