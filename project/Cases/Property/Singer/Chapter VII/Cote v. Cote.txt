89 Md. App. 729,599 A.2d 869, 1992 Md. App.

Brief Fact Summary
A man was served with a restraining order, which prevented him from entering his house.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Three elements must be established to constitute a taking: (1) state action; (2) which affects a property interest in the constitutional sense; and (3) which deprives the owner of all beneficial use of his or her property.

Facts
Paula Cote (Defendant) and Charles Cote (Plaintiff) divorced, and Plaintiff was barred from entering the family home because of domestic abuse. Plaintiff argues that the order barring him from his real property was an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation.

Issue
Is an order barring someone from his marital home a taking of property without just compensation?

Held
No.

Discussion
In a domestic abuse situation, the abuser can be barred from entering the marital home for a temporary period without being a taking. The abuser does not have to pay for additional housing for his victim-spouse, so he is still receiving a benefit from his property.
