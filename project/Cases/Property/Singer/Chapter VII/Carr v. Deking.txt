Brief Fact Summary
In a tenancy in common, one co-tenant makes a lease with a third party, unknown to and against the wishes of the co-tenant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In a tenancy in common, a cotenant may lease his interest in the common property to a third party without the consent of the other tent.

Facts
Joel Carr (Plaintiff) and his father George Carr owned a parcel of land as tenants in common. They leased the land to Richard Deking (Defendant) on a year-to-year oral agreement over several years. One year, Plaintiff informed Defendant that he wanted cash rent, but Defendant did not agree. Defendant and George Carr entered into a ten- year lease, unknown to Plaintiff. Plaintiff never consented to the lease and did not authorize his father to act on his behalf. Plaintiff informed Defendant that his lease had expired, but Defendant claimed possession through the lease with George Carr. Plaintiff seeks to eject Defendant; Defendant seeks partition.

Issue
In a tenancy in common, can one co-tenant enter into a lease with respect to his own undivided one-half interest in the property without the consent of the other co-tenant?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Co-owners of real property have the right to lease the land without the knowledge or consent of the other co-owners. When co-owners cannot agree on the use of the property, the court may order a partition, which is a division of the land.
