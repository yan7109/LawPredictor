Brief Fact Summary
A couple sold their house when relying on another person’s oral promise to sell them land.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An oral contract for the sale of land is enforceable if it is established that the party reasonably relied on the contract and changed his position so that injustice can only be avoided by specific performance of the contract.

Facts
Gladys Green (Defendant) owned a parcel of property that she wanted to sell. She discussed with the Hickeys (Plaintiffs) their purchase of the lot, and orally agreed to a sale. Plaintiffs provided a deposit for the land. Plaintiffs told Defendant that they were selling their home and building on her lot. Plaintiffs then sold their home. Defendant told Plaintiffs that she would not sell her property to them because there was a better deal elsewhere. Plaintiffs sought specific performance, and Defendant defended with the statute of frauds.

Issue
When a person acts in reliance on an oral promise to sell land but the seller then changes his mind, can an action for specific performance be successfully brought?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
A change in position in reliance on an oral agreement will entitle a purchaser to specific performance, especially if the seller admits that the oral contract was made.
