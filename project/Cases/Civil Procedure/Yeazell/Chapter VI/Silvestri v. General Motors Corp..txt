Dissent


Concurrence</span>   </br><span class="heading">Discussion
Spoliation refers to the destruction or material alteration of evidence or the failure to preserve property for another’s use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation.  Here the prejudice suffered by General Motors was “highly prejudicial” because it denied General Motors access to the only evidence from which it could develop its defenses adequately.
