22 Ill.937 F.2d 82, 19 U.S.P.Q.2d 1519 (2d Cir. 1991)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff sued Defendant in federal court for misappropriation of confidential trade secrets and punitive damages. The District Court dismissed on the grounds that Plaintiff did not show that it met the requisite jurisdictional amount (in excess of $50,000). Plaintiff appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law

Plaintiff appealed, arguing that the District Court applied an incorrect standard in making this deter

Issue
Did the District Court apply the correct standard in dismissing Plaintiff’s case for failure to establish that Plaintiff could recover the jurisdictional amount?

Held
No. The judgment is vacated and remanded for further proceedings.

Discussion
This opinion shows that as long as the plaintiff alleges damages in excess of the jurisdictional amount, the case will not be dismissed unless the plaintiff acted in bad faith in alleging this amount of damages.
