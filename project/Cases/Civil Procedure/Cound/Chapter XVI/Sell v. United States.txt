Brief Fact Summary
An individual had a history of mental illness, but refused to take antipsychotic medicine while confined to a state treatment facility.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Forcibly medicating an inmate for trial competence purposes is only appropriate in certain instances.

Facts
The Petitioner, Charles Sell (the “Petitioner”), has a history of mental illness.  The Petitioner was charged with submitting fictitious insurance claims for payment.  A Federal Magistrate judge ordered the Petitioner to undergo a psychiatric examination.  The Petitioner was deemed “currently competent”, but at risk to suffer “a psychotic episode” sometime in the future.  The Petitioner was released on bail. A superseding indictment was produced charging the Petitioner with various counts of fraud and one mount of money laundering.  During the proceedings, the government claimed that the Petitioner sought to intimidate a witness and as a result his bail was revoked.  The Petitioner was then indicted for attempting to murder the FBI agent that arrested him and an individual who was going to testify against him.  The cases were joined for trial.

Issue
“[W]hether the Constitution permits the Government to administer antipsychotic drugs involuntarily to a mentally ill criminal defendant–in order to render that defendant competent to stand trial for serious, but nonviolent, crimes[?]”  Or, in other words “[d]oes forced administration of antipsychotic drugs to render Sell competent to stand trial unconstitutionally deprive him of his ‘liberty’ to reject medical treatment?”

Held
Yes, “the Constitution allows the Government to administer those drugs, even against the defendant’s will, in limited circumstances.”

Discussion
This case concerns when a state can force an inmate to take antipsychotic medication.
