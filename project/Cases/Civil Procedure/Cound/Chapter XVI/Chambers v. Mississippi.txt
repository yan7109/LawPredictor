Brief Fact Summary
The Petitioner, Leon Chambers (the “Petitioner”) was tried and convicted of murdering a police officer.  A jury found that he should serve life in prison.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“[T]he exclusion of this critical evidence, coupled with the State’s refusal to permit [the Petitioner] to cross-examine McDonald, denied him a trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process. In reaching this judgment, [the majority] establish[ed] no new principles of constitutional law. Nor [did its] holding signal any diminution in the respect traditionally accorded to the States in the establishment and implementation of their own criminal trial rules and procedures. Rather, [the majority] quite simply that under the facts and circumstances of this case the rulings of the trial court deprived [the Petitioner] of a fair trial.”

Facts
Two police officers attempted to arrest somebody in a bar, but their attempts were frustrated by a group of bar patrons.  The officers called for back up and one of the two officers brought a riot rifle into the bar.  Three other officers arrived and they attempted to arrest the same individual.  Once again, the bar patrons did not allow them to do so.  Shortly thereafter, the shooting began.  One of the original two police officers was shot and killed, but after being shot and before dying, he shot the Petitioner.

Issue
Whether the Petitioner’s right to a fair trial were violated?

Held
“The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one’s own behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.”  These two elements of a fair trial are implicated here.
