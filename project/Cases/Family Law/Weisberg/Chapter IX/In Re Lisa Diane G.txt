537 A.2d 131,1988 R.I.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs sought to nullify the adoption of daughter based on alleged fraudulent conduct or misrepresentations of the adoptive agency.  The Family Court found that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Family Court has jurisdiction to nullify an adoption if plaintiffs can prove their claim of fraudulent conduct or misrepresentations by clear and convincing evidence.

Facts
Plaintiffs, adoptive parents of an 8 year old daughter, complain that their adoption decree was procured by the fraudulent conduct or misrepresentations of certain representatives of the Department of Children and Their Families (DCF).  Plaintiffs contend that DCF never informed them that the staff of a hospital known for treatment of the emotionally disturbed informed DCF that the 8 year old should not be placed for adoption due to her behavioral problems.  The plaintiffs sought nullification of the adoption decree and compensation for expenses incurred.  On order was entered denying the parents’ complaint for a lack of jurisdiction.  At the court’s insistence, counsel for DCF filed a petition asking that the daughter, now a teenager, be declared a dependent child and placed in the custody of the state.
