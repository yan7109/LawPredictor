Brief Fact Summary
Luanne and John had an embryo genetically unrelated to either of them implanted in a surrogate.  The couple separated, and John disclaimed any parental responsibility for the child.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a married couple consent to in vitro fertilization by unknown donors and subsequent implantation into a surrogate, the couple are the legal parents of the offspring.

Facts
Jaycee was born as a result of Luanne and John Buzzanca’s decision to have an embryo genetically unrelated to either of them implanted in a woman surrogate, who would carry and give birth to the child for them.  After the pregnancy, Luanne and John split up, and the question arose as to who were Jaycee’s lawful parents.  Luanne claimed she and her erstwhile husband where the lawful parents, but John disclaimed any responsibility, financial or otherwise.  The woman who gave birth made no claim to the child.  The trial court determined that Jaycee had no lawful parents.

Issue
Did the trial court err in its determination that Jaycee had no lawful parents?

Held
The trial court erred because it assumed that legal motherhood under California statute could only be established in one of two ways, either by giving birth or by contributing an egg.

Discussion
The Court acknowledges that statutory law does not cover the present scenario, but determines that the Legislative intend would be to assign legal parenthood to John and Luanne.
