45 S.W.3d 449,2001 Ky. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Sharon filed a motion to increase Donald’s child support obligations as a result of a substantial increase in his monthly income.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This Court follows the Income Shares Model, under which a child should receive the same proportion o parental income that the child would have received if the parent’s had not been divorced.

Facts
Donald and Sharon Downing were divorced in 1992.  She received sole custody of the children.  In 1998 she filed a motion to increase Donald’s child support obligations based upon a substantial increase in his income.  The Domestic Relations Commissioner (DRC) found that his monthly income had increased by $40,000.  The Commissioner recognized that this greatly exceeded the highest level set in the child support guidelines, and determined that he would increase the child support at a rate of 4% of combined income based on the approximate percentage increases at the high income end of the chart.

Issue
Did the DRC err by relying primarily upon a mathematical equation in increasing Donald’s child support obligations?

Held
The trial court erred by failing to take into consideration the reasonable needs of the children and the standard of living enjoyed by the parents.

Discussion
The Court analogizes its decision to the “Three Pony Rule,” meaning that no child, no matter how wealthy the parents, needs to be provided with more than three ponies.
