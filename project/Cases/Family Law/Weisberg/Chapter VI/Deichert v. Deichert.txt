Brief Fact Summary
Appellant filed bankruptcy and attempted to discharge several debts assigned to him in a previous divorce.  The trial court found that several of the support debts were non-dischargeable.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Debts created to perform a support function are non-dischargeable in bankruptcy.

Facts
Approximately 8 months after a final divorce decree, appellant Dr. Robert Deichert filed a voluntary petition for Chapter VII bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court describing himself as married but separated.  Appellee Eleanor Deichert was not listed as a creditor in any required Schedule A statements concerning debtor liabilities.  Appellant listed the marital residence and a station wagon as real and exempt assets respectively, although both had been granted to appellee pursuant to the divorce decree.  The Bankruptcy Judge entered a Discharge of Debtor Order releasing appellant from all personal liability for debts existing on the date the bankruptcy case was instituted.  Debts determined non-dischargeable were excluded.  At a hearing on appellee’s enforcement petition appellant claimed his obligations had been discharged by the Bankruptcy Court.  The court designated various marital obligations in the divorce decree and order as dischargeable or not in bankruptcy

Issue
Did the court properly determine that some of appellant’s obligations under the divorce decree where non-dischargeable in bankruptcy?

Held
The court properly determined that appellant’s obligations were non-dischargeable.

Discussion
The Court noted that appellant had abused the procedures of the courts in attempting to avoid such support debts through bankruptcy.
