Brief Fact Summary
An unmarried couple was denied housing.  They brought suit claiming housing discrimination in violation of the North Dakota Human Rights Act.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In order to give both the Act and a statute forbidding cohabitation meaning, the court found that the cohabitation statute bans conduct rather than status.  Therefore, failure to rent to an unmarried couple is not a violation of the Act.

Facts
An unmarried couple, Robert and Patricia Kippen, tried to rent from David and Mary Peterson, who refused because the unmarried couple was seeking to cohabit.  The North Dakota Fair Housing Counsel and the Kippens sued, claiming housing discrimination in violation of the North Dakota Human Rights Act.  The district court granted a motion to dismiss due to a lack of standing on behalf of the Housing Counsel and granted summary judgment on behalf of the Petersons over the Kipplins.

Issue
Does refusing to rent to an unmarried couple because they are seeking to cohabit violate the discriminatory housing practices provision of the North Dakota Human Rights Act?

Held
The refusal to rent to a couple seeking to cohabit does not violate the Act because it is supported by an existing criminal cohabitation statute.

Discussion
Because both the Act and the cohabitation statute were valid laws, the court applied the Act in a way that allowed both laws to still be applicable.
