74 N.Y.2d 201,543 N.E.2d 49,544 N.Y.S.2d 784,1989 N.Y.

Brief Fact Summary
Two men lived as life partners for over ten years.  Upon his partner’s death appellant was threatened by respondent with eviction based on the theory that he was not a family member as protected by rent control law.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Without legislative definition, the court determines the definition of family by examining the intent of the legislation.  Based on the intent of the rent control law, an expansive definition of family is appropriate.

Facts
Appellant Miguel Braschi lived with Leslie Blanchard in a rent controlled apartment form the summer of 1975 until Blanchard’s death in September of 1986.  Respondent Stahl Associates Co. threatened eviction proceedings against appellant, contending that he was a mere licensee with no right to occupy the apartment since only Blanchard was tenant of record.

Issue
Is a couple living in a marriage-like relationship but not formally married protected under New York Rent Control law?

Held
The term family, as used in the applicable statute, should not be rigidly restricted to those who have formalized their relationship by obtaining a marriage certificate.

Discussion
The court determined that based on the purpose of the statute a more expansive definition of family should be applicable.  The court also provides a useful list of factors to determine family.
