794 P.2d 97,1990 Alas.

Brief Fact Summary
Mother and Father married and produced one child from the marriage.  The two separated, but alternated custody and cooperated in making most major decisions.  The trial court awarded legal and physical custody of the child to Mother.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Alaskan statutory law favors joint legal custody when possible, regardless of the physical custody arrangement.

Facts
Greg and Debra Bell married in 1986 and separated in 1987.  While married, the two shared most child rearing tasks.  Sharon Nollman babysat the couples’ child part-time in 1996 and full-time in 1987.  She continued to babysit until February 1988, when this trial occurred.  The couple agreed to share custody upon separation, with both using Nollman to babysit.  They accommodated each other’s schedules.  An interim custody hearing directed the couple to continue their weekly alternating schedule of shared physical custody, and to continue utilizing Nollman for babysitting.  They continued to accommodate one another and cooperating in making major decisions about their sons medical care.  The trial court awarded legal and physical custody of the child to Debra, allowing Greg visitation on alternating weekends and during four one-week periods spread throughout the year.  Greg appealed.

Issue
Did the trial court err under Alaskan law by not awarding joint custody to both parents?

Held
The court’s ruling was clearly erroneous because the evidence did not support the court’s ruling that the couple were incapable of meaningful communication and/or negotiation.

Discussion
The case demonstrates the difference between joint legal and joint physical custody, and the Court supports the public interest of joint legal custody based upon the public interest to encourage parents to share the rights and responsibilities of child rearing.
