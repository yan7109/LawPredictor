Brief Fact Summary
Mother protested a custody award that provided father with overnight visitation after father had been convicted of sexually molesting his stepdaughter and accused of molesting his daughter.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The court must provide suitable protection in the best interests of the child, and cannot use a custody award as punishment against one party.

Facts
Mr. and Ms. Hanke divorced, with Ms. Hanke being granted custody of the parties’ child and Mr. Hanke being granted unsupervised bi-weekly four-hour visitations pending a mental health examination.  Mr. Hanke had previously admitted sexually abusing his 11-year old stepchild.  There was also overwhelming evidence of other instances of excessive punishment with sexual overtones.  Mr. Hanke stated that he was drunk when the incident occurred, but he did not need therapy for alcoholism.  He did have therapy for the sexual abuse incident.  Mrs. Hanke was pregnant with the parties’ child at the time of separation and the separation occurred as soon as she learned that her 11 year old child had been sexually molested by Mr. Hanke.  Criminal charges were brought against Mr. Hanke regarding the incident, and a plea bargain was entered into which provided for supervised visitation of the parties’ child.  Following one of Mr. Hanke’s unsupervised visits, the child reported sexual abuse.

Issue
Did the court abuse its discretion by awarding overnight visitation to Mr. Hanke?

Held
The court’s decision was clearly wrong because it failed to at least provide a specific place for the supervised visitation designated to protect the child fully with supervisors satisfactory to all parties.

Discussion
This case demonstrates that a court cannot use a custody award to punish a party, but rather must focus on the best interests of the child.
