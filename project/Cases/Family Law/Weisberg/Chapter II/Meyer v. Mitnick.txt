244 Mich. App. 697,625 N.W.2d 136,2001 Mich. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff and defendant were engaged to marry and plaintiff gave defendant an engagement ring.  The engagement was terminated and plaintiff brought suit against defendant to recover the ring.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Because engagement rings are conditional gifts given in contemplation of marriage, the ring should be returned to the donor on breaking of the engagement without a determination regarding fault.

Facts
Plaintiff  Barry Meyer and defendant Robyn Mitnick became engaged.  Plaintiff gave defendant a custom designed engagement ring.  Plaintiff asked defendant to sign a prenuptial agreement and defendant refused, causing the engagement to be broken.  Both parties claimed the other caused the breakup.  Barry brought suit for the engagement ring, claiming it was a conditional gift given in contemplation of marriage.  Defendant counterclaimed that the ring was an unconditional gift, and that she was entitled to keep it because plaintiff broke off the engagement.  The trial court granted plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.

Issue
When determining ownership of an engagement ring following termination of an engagement, should fault be considered?

Held
Engagement rings should be considered conditional gifts given in contemplation of marriage.

Discussion
The Court finds that a fault determination should not be examined because fault is impossible to fix based on the inherently fickle reasons people choose to not marry.
