170 Vt. 194, 744 A.2d 864 (1999)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs, three same-sex couples who have lived in committed relationships for significant periods, brought suit seeking judgment that a statute disallowing same sex marriage was unconstitutional under state law and the state constitution.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A law that prohibited same-sex couples from receiving the same benefits and protections that married opposite-sex couples received violated the Vermont Constitution.

Facts
Plaintiffs, three same-sex couples who have lived in committed relationships for significant periods, brought suit seeking judgment that a statute disallowing same sex marriage was unconstitutional under state law and the state constitution.  Two of the same-sex couples had raised children together.

Issue
May the State of Vermont exclude same-sex couples from the benefits and protections that its laws provide to married couples under the Vermont Constitution?

Held
The State is constitutionally required to extend to same-sex couples the same benefits and protections that flow from marriage under Vermont law.

Discussion
While the Court found the law in violation of the Vermont Constitution, it did not find that marriage licenses for same-sex couples were required.  Rather, the same common benefits and protections could be extended to same-sex couples in a variety of ways.
