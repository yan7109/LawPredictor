504 U.S. 689,112 S. Ct. 2206,119 L. Ed. 2d 468,1992 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Petitioner sought to bring a federal tortious action against respondents for the abuse of her children based on diversity-of-citizenship.  The district court dismissed the action based on the domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The domestic relations exception to diversity jurisdiction applies only to the power of the federal courts to issue divorce, alimony, or child custody decrees.

Facts
Petitioner Carol Ankenbrandt brought suit on behalf of her daughters against respondents Jon Richards and Debra Kesler seeking monetary damages for alleged sexual and physical abuse of the daughters.  Petitioner, a citizen of Missouri brought suit in federal court against respondents, citizens of Louisiana, based on the diversity-of-citizenship provision of Section: 1332.  Richards was the divorced father of the children and Kesler his female companion.  The District Court granted respondents’ motion to dismiss based on the “domestic relations” exception to diversity jurisdiction.

Issue
Is there a domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction, and if such an exception exists, does it permit a district court to abstain from exercising diversity jurisdiction in a tort action for damages?

Held
Federal subject-matter jurisdiction is proper in this case pursuant to Section:1332 because the domestic relations exception encompasses only cases involving the issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.

Discussion
The domestic relations exception applies even in cases where the plaintiffs establish the requisite diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy.
