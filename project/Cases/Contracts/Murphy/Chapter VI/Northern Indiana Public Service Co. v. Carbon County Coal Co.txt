Brief Fact Summary
Carbon County Coal Company (Plaintiff) had a contract with Defendant to supply coal. Defendant found a much cheaper supply of coal and sought a declaratory judgment to be released from the contract. Plaintiff counter sued for a preliminary injunction and specific performance.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Specific performance is not appropriate when there is and adequate remedy at law and declaring specific performance would further injure the defendant and society as a whole.

Facts
Plaintiff had a contract to supply defendant with coal. Defendant found a cheaper supplier of coal and sought a declaratory judgment to be released from the contract. Plaintiff counter sued for a preliminary injunction and specific performance. After a jury trial, Plaintiff received an award of $181 million dollars.

Issue
Should Plaintiff get specific performance?

Held
No.

Discussion
Beyond the usual reason for denying specific performance, the court finds public policy reasons for not granting specific performance. Still, the case turns on the fact that money damages were enough to make the Plaintiff whole.
