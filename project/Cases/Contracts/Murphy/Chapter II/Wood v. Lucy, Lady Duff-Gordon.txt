Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Lady Duff-Gordon (Defendant), agreed to allow the Plaintiff, Wood (Plaintiff), to promote her product and split profits. When Defendant places an endorsement without Plaintiff, he sues for withheld profits.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Mutuality can be implied based on the terms of a contract.

Facts
Defendant is a fashion designer who entered into an agreement that Plaintiff would in her employment promote her label. In return they were to split the profits. Defendant placed an endorsement without Plaintiff’s knowledge and withheld profits from him. In exchange for an exclusive agency he would promote her trademarks, but never exclusively to promise work.

Issue
Can there be mutuality implied in a contract?

Held
Yes. Reversed.

Discussion
The court places a duty of good faith on the parties based on the terms agreed to between the parties. Due to the fact the promise has value (1/2 profits and no up front fee) the court places a duty on the parties.
