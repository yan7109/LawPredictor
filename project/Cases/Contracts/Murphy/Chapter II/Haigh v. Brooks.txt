Plaintiff sued Defendant that denies the debt failure to follow the Statue of Frauds and lack of consideration.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a party to a contract does something that they do not have to do or does not do something they have the right to do, no matter how small, that act can constitute consideration and bind the other party.

Facts
Defendant appeals a judgment against him from the lower court to the Queen’s Bench.

Issue
Should Defendant’s agreement to guarantee Lees’s debt be enforced?

Held
Yes, Defendant’s agreement to guarantee Lee’s debt shall be upheld

Discussion
The court entertained more than one theory that would hold Defendant to his agreement to guarantee Lees’ debt. First they raised the possibility that Plaintiff’s giving Lees credit was consideration for Defendant to guarantee Lees’ debt. They raised a second theory of consideration, giving up the written agreement provided the consideration necessary to hold Defendant to his agreement.
