22 Ill.11 Utah 2d 433, 361 P.2d 177 (1961)

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Oyler (Defendant), failed to repay debts owed to the Plaintiff, Manwill (Plaintiff), within the statute of limitations (SOL) period. After the statutory period, the Defendant made an oral promise to repay the balance of the debt. Plaintiff sues to enforce the promise.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Moral obligation cannot operate as consideration with a few limited exceptions. Something of legal benefit or detriment, instead, must be conferred.

Facts
Plaintiff made payments on Defendant’s behalf amounting to over $5,500 between 1950-1953 on Defendant’s farm. In 1954, Plaintiff transferred to Defendants a grazing permit worth $1,800 and cattle worth $3,000. Any action on these debts would be barred by the Statute Of Limitations. In October of 1957, Defendant made an oral promise to pay Plaintiff back.

Issue
Can a subsequent verbal promise count as consideration?

Held
No. Reversed.

Discussion
The Court has focused on the promisor and the law’s precedent to not inject moral obligation into the law of contracts. If a promisor wants a moral obligation to have binding force, he or she must make it very clear and explicit in order for the court to enforce it.
