22 Ill.811 F.2d 326 (7th Cir. 1987)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs were the owners of a failing Ford dealership. They agreed to resign as Ford dealers. During negations with Ford Motor Company (Defendant), concerning the winding down of the dealership, several issues remained unresolved.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
One may not circumvent a mediation clause in a contract by saying that you have fulfilled the mediation clause’s purposes in other ways.

Facts
Defendant accepted their resignation and agreed to buy back their inventory. Disputes over buying back the inventory and other issues gave rise to this lawsuit. The issue is a provision in the sales agreement providing for conflicts, which are to be appealed to the Policy Board. The provision further provides that the appeal to the Policy Board was a condition precedent to a dealer’s right to pursue any other remedy available to a dealer under the law.

Issue
Does the fact that Plaintiffs did not appeal to the Policy Board defeat their claim?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Alternative dispute resolution agreements in a contract are generally upheld and performance is narrowly construed unless it can be shown that the agreement treated on of the parties unjustly.
