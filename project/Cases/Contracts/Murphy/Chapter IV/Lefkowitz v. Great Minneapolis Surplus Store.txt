22 Ill.251 Minn. 188, 86 N.W.2d 689 (1957)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant advertised the sale of three fur coats and three fur stoles for $1.00 a piece. The advertisement said “first come, first serve”. Plaintiff arrived at Defendant’s store wishing to buy the garments. Defendant refused, saying the sale was only for women.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An advertisement may be considered an offer when it promises something in exchange for clear, definite action, and leaves nothing open for negotiation. Otherwise, an advertisement is an invitation for an offer.

Facts
Defendant ran two newspaper advertisements, one stating that Defendant would sell three fur coats, valued at $100.00 a piece, first come, first served, and the other, stating that Defendant would sell three fur stoles, valued between $89.00 and $139.50 for one dollar a piece. Plaintiff arrived first on both occasions, and presented $3.00. Defendant refused to sell the items to Plaintiff, citing a “house rule” which limited the bargains to women.

Issue
Did Defendant’s advertisement constitute an offer?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The court held that a newspaper ad could be considered an offer under certain circumstances, particularly when the actions needed to accept the offer are clear. In this case, the advertisement was clear, definite, and leaves nothing to be left open for negotiation.
