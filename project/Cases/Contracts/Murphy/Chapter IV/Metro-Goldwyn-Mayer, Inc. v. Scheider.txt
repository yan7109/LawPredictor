22 Ill.40 N.Y.2d 1069, 392 N.Y.S.2d 252, 360 N.E.2d 930 (1976)

Brief Fact Summary
The Appellant, Scheider (Appellant), agreed to be a principal actor in a pilot film and in any ensuing television series, which could develop therefrom. The Appellant later refused to be in the series, after being fully compensated for performing in the film.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case stands for the proposition that when a party to a contract begins performance under an understanding that an agreement has been entered into, he will be bound to complete his performance.

Facts
The trial court found that, by performing in the film, Appellant began performance on the good faith assumption there was an agreement and although terms were incomplete, the court was within its discretion to find and enforce an agreement. Judgment for the Appellee, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (Appellee). Appellant appealed.

Issue
This case presents the question of whether there was a complete contract, arising from an oral agreement between the parties, which could be upheld.

Held
Affirmed.

Discussion
Again, it is important to look to the intention of the parties, in determining whether a contract was meant to be created. Performance in furtherance of an agreement is a good indicator that an agreement did, in fact, exist.
