Brief Fact Summary
Defendant offered to sell 2000 to 5000 tons of 50 lb iron rails, to Plaintiff, which was to be accepted by December 20, 1879, to be valid. On December 16, 1879 plaintiff wrote defendant ordering 1200 tons of rails. Defendant responded that the order could not be taken at the agreed upon price and Plaintiff sued for performance.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case illustrates the Mirror Image Rule. When an offer is made, the acceptance must mirror the offer to be valid.

Facts
The Plaintiff, Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway Co. (Plaintiff), approached the Defendant, Columbus Rolling-Mill Co. (Defendant), for a quote on iron rails to be delivered in March of 1880. Defendant replied with an offer to sell 2000 to 5000 tons of 50 lb rails, which was to be accepted by December 20, 1879, to be valid. On December 16, 1879 plaintiff wrote defendant ordering 1200 tons of rails. Defendant responded that the order could not be taken at the agreed upon price and Plaintiff sued for performance.

Issue
The issue presented herein is whether the Plaintiff made a valid acceptance when it accepted Defendant’s terms subsequent to their attempt to change the offered terms.

Held
Judgment Affirmed.

Discussion
This case illustrates the importance of the form of an offer and acceptance, in order for mutual assent to be reached. If an offer is made and by its terms is to be accepted on its face, any modification of the terms constitutes a rejection of the offer. Additionally, consider the notion of The Battle of the Forms. In this case, competing letters and telegrams were used by the parties in trying to prove their cases, but it was clear that there was a disagreement as to the quantities of rails to be ordered. It is often the case that the disagreement is not so clear and competing documents could strengthen the cases of either party. In such a situation, the mirror image rule becomes more important in trying to determine whether a valid offer and acceptance have been made.
