Facts
Plaintiff is a general contractor. Plaintiff was preparing a bid to build a school. Defendant, a paving company, submitted a bid for the paving work of $7,131.60. Defendants bid was the lowest bid, thus, Plaintiff used it in calculating his bid. Plaintiff submitted the lowest bide to the government. Plaintiff went to Defendant’s office to introduce himself. When he arrived, an employee told him that the bid was a mistake and Defendant could not do the work at the price quoted. Plaintiff tried, for several months, to find another subcontractor to do the work at the price defendant quoted, but had to use a contractor who charged $3,000 more than Defendant’s quote.
