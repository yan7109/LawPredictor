Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff/buyer contracted with the Defendant/seller to purchase and deliver steel to a third party. Defendant then told Plaintiff the steel was not merchantable and orally directed Plaintiff to return three loads of steel to Defendant. Plaintiff contends that it was told that if it did not pay the price of the undelivered loads, Defendant would cease doing business with Plaintiff. Plaintiff sued, based on extortion.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In order to prove economic duress, an existing and ongoing contractual relationship is generally necessary.

Facts
The Plaintiff, Machinery Hauling, Inc. (Plaintiff), the buyer, contracted with the Defendant, Steel of West Virginia (Defendant), the seller, to purchase and deliver steel to a third party. Defendant later learned that the steel was unmerchantable and directed Plaintiff to return it. Plaintiff contends that it was told that if it did not pay the price of the undelivered loads, Defendant would cease doing business with Plaintiff. Plaintiff sued, based on extortion.

Issue
This case questions what level of threat is sufficient to invoke recovery under a theory of economic duress.

Held
Questions Answered in agreement with Lower Courts; Action dismissed.

Discussion
If there is no ongoing contractual relationship, a party cannot claim economic duress because of a loss they may incur in the future. Economic duress is available as a remedy when a party has actually performed an act because of a compulsion to do so, generally in desperate circumstances.
