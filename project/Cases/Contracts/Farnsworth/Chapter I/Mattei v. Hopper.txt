Brief Fact Summary
P brought an action against D for breach of contract because D failed to convey to P real property in accordance with the terms of a deposit receipt.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An agreement made subject to the satisfaction of leases does not render a contract illusory or void it for lack of mutuality because of the requirement of good faith.

Facts
Mattei (P) was a real estate developer. P planned to construct a shopping center adjacent to land owned by Hopper (D). P entered into an agreement with D for the purchase of D’s land. The parties reduced the agreement to writing. Under the terms of the agreement, P was required to deposit $1,000 of the total purchase price of $57,500, and was given 120 days to examine the title and consummate the purchase. At the expiration of 120 days, the balance of the purchase price was due and payable upon tender of a good and sufficient deed of the property sold. The agreement was made subject to Coldwell Banker & Co. obtaining leases satisfactory to the purchaser. P paid the $1,000 deposit. While P was securing the leases, D notified P that D would not sell P the land under the terms of the agreement. Satisfactory leases were obtained and P offered to pay the balance of the purchase price. D failed to tender the deed. P alleged a breach of contract and brought an action for damages. Jud

Issue
Is the satisfaction clause illusory or lacking in mutuality of agreement and thus an invalid consideration?
