Citation
22 Ill.129 Cal.App.2d 179, 276 P.2d 8 (Ct. App. 1954)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Lonergan, responded to an ad placed by Defendant, Scolnick for land the Defendant was interested in selling. Plaintiff corresponded with Defendant through a series of letters. Defendant sold the land to a third party.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An invitation for offers does not operate as an offer to create an enforceable contract.

Facts
Defendant placed an ad in a newspaper indicating that he wished to sell some property. In response to an inquiry from Plaintiff, Defendant sent Plaintiff a form letter describing the property, giving directions to the property, and indicated the lowest price he would accept for the property. Plaintiff wrote Defendant to request a legal description of the property and to suggest an escrow agent “should I desire to purchase the land.” Defendant wrote Plaintiff back including a legal description, approval of the escrow agent, and warning Plaintiff that he expected to have a buyer soon.

Issue
Did the parties enter into a contract?

Held
No. The parties did not enter into a contract.

Discussion
An enforceable contract requires an offer and acceptance. In the present case Defendant made an invitation for offers, but at no time made an offer to Plaintiff. Because Defendant at no time made an offer, Plaintiff could not have accepted an offer to create a binding contract.
