Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs Normile and Segal both attempted to purchase a piece of real estate from Defendant Miller. Normile first submitted a bid, but Plaintiff responded with a counteroffer. Prior to Normile’s acceptance of Defendant’s counteroffer, Defendant sold the property to Segal.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A counteroffer acts as a rejection of the original offer and does not contain the terms of the original offer. The counteroffer, like the original offer, must be accepted before it is revoked.

Facts
On August 4, Defendant listed a piece of real estate. Normile was shown the property by a real estate broker. Upon seeing the property, Normile and the real estate broker prepared an offer. The offer specified that it must be accepted by 5:00 p.m. on August 5. Defendant received the offer, made several changes, signed and returned the offer to Normile. When the real estate broker presented the counteroffer to Normile, Normile neither accepted nor rejected the counteroffer and indicated that they were going to wait to decide what to do. However, the real estate broker was under the impression that Normile was rejecting the counteroffer based on statements made by Normile. Normile indicated that the increased amount of earnest money and decreased duration of the loan were problematic.

Issue
Is there an enforceable contract to purchase the property between Normile and Defendant?

Held
No. There is not an enforceable contract between Normile and Defendant to purchase the property

Discussion
In this case, Defendant rejected Normile’s offer by submitting a counteroffer. Because the counteroffer operated as a rejection of Normile’s original offer, the terms of Normile’s original offer were not transferred to the counteroffer. Normile did not have a contract to purchase the property from Defendant because Normile failed to accept the counteroffer before it was revoked.
