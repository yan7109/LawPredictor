22 Ill.36 N.Y. St. Rptr. 888, 124 N.Y. 538, 27 N.E. 256 (1891)

Brief Fact Summary
William E. Story, Sr. (hereinafter Uncle) promised to give William E. Story, 2d (hereinafter Nephew) $5,000 if he refrained from certain behavior prior to reaching the age of twenty-one. Plaintiff, an assignee of Nephew, has brought this claim against Defendant, executor of Uncle, to enforce the promise made by Uncle.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Refraining from behavior one has a legal right to engage in may be sufficient consideration to make an agreement enforceable.

Facts
At the celebration of the anniversary of Nephews parents and in the presence of family and guests, Uncle promised to give Nephew $5,000 if Nephew did not drink, use tobacco, swear, or play cards or billiard for money before reaching the age of twenty-one. Upon reaching the age of twenty-one, Nephew wrote Uncle to inform him that he had met all of the conditions necessary to receive the $5,000. Uncle wrote Nephew confirming that the money was his, but indicated that Uncle would hold on to it until he thought Nephew was capable of having it. Uncle died prior to transferring any of the $5,000 to Nephew.

Issue
Can Plaintiff recover the $5,000 from Defendant?

Held
Yes. Because Nephew refrained from behavior he had a legal right to engage in, sufficient consideration existed to make Uncle’s promise enforceable.

Discussion
In the present case, Nephew met the conditions of Uncle’s promise by refraining from behavior he had a legal right to engage in. Meeting Uncle’s conditions supplied sufficient consideration to make the agreement enforceable.
