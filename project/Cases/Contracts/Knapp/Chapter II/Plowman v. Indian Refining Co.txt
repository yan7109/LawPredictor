22 Ill.20 F. Supp. 1 (E.D. Ill. 1937)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs, Plowman and seventeen others similarly situated or their estates, worked for Defendant Indian Refining Co., for many years. Defendant offered to pay Plaintiffs one-half of the wages currently being earned. Plaintiffs remained on the payroll, receiving the offered money, but did not render any services other than coming to the office for their remittance.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Past consideration or past performance is not consideration.

Facts
Defendant told Plaintiffs that they would receive half of their current wages every payday for the rest of their life. The consideration for this agreement was a desire to provide for the welfare of these older employees who had worked for Defendant for many years. Plaintiffs remained on Defendant’s payroll and insurance payments continued to be deducted from the checks. However, Plaintiffs were not required to perform any services other than coming to pick up their checks at the office every payday. The payments were made for almost a year before Defendant informed Plaintiffs that they were terminating the arrangement.

Issue
Was there sufficient consideration to make the agreement an enforceable contract?

Held
No. Past consideration is not sufficient consideration to make an agreement enforceable.

Discussion
Under these facts, Plaintiffs could not show valid consideration to make the promise enforceable. Plaintiffs’ best argument was likely that their past performance of services to their employer, Defendant, operated as consideration for the promise. However, past consideration is not valid consideration.
