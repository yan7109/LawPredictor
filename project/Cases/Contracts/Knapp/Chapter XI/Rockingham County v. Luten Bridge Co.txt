Brief Fact Summary
A company hired to build a bridge continued work on the bridge, even after the county repudiated the contract.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Once a contract is breached, the non-breaching party has a duty not to increase the resulting damages.

Facts
The Defendant, Rockingham County (Defendant), hired the Plaintiff, Luten Bridge Co. (Plaintiff), to construct a bridge. Thereafter, the County Commission voted not to continue with the construction of the bridge and informed the Plaintiff to stop work on the bridge contract. The Plaintiff, however, continued constructing the bridge. The Plaintiff then filed suit to recover damages stemming from The Defendant’s breach of contract.

Issue
Does a non-breaching party have a duty to mitigate damages stemming from the other party’s breach?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed and remanded.

Discussion
The court examined the facts of the case and found that the Plaintiff had notice that the Defendant breached the contract. It then looked to case law, which provides that in such a case, the Plaintiff has a duty not to aggravate damages.
