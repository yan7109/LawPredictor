Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Crabtree alleges that Defendant Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp. breached a two year employment contract.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
More than one document may be linked together either expressly or impliedly by the subject matter and occasion to supply a memo to satisfy the statute of frauds.

Facts
Plaintiff sought a three year employment contract with Defendant. Plaintiff was leaving a secure job to enter a new field and wanted the agreement to be for a definite term. Defendant instead offered Plaintiff a two year employment contract with an annual salary of $20,000 for the first six months, $25,000 for the next six months, and $30,000 for the second year. Plaintiff called the offer “interesting.” Defendant had the offer written down on a telephone order.

Issue
Was the lower court justified in finding that the contract satisfied the statute of frauds?

Held
Yes. The lower court was justified in finding that the contract satisfied the statute of frauds

Discussion
In the present case, the trial court was justified in finding a sufficient memo to satisfy the statute of frauds by linking the three documents together.
