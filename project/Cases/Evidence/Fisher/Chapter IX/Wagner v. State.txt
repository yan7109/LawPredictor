130 S. Ct. 573

Brief Fact Summary
Arthur Wagner, III (Appellant) was convicted of one court of sale of cocaine and two counts of sale of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school.  At Appellant’s trial, a videotape was allowed into evidence, which showed Appellant handing an informant something in exchange for money.  Appellant appeals his conviction here, arguing that the videotape evidence was improperly admitted.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Videotape and photographic evidence is admissible under the “silent witness” theory when the reliability of the process used to create the evidence is proved, and when the trial judge determines the evidence to be reliable.

Facts
Officer Duncan (Duncan) and an informant made purchases of crack cocaine from a vehicle that was equipped with a video camera; the purchases were made by the informant from the driver’s side of the vehicle.

Issue
At Appellant’s trial for various counts of sale of cocaine and sale of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school, did the lower court error by admitting into evidence a videotape of the alleged drug buys?

Held
No; the videotape was admissible under the “silent witness” theory, which allows videotape evidence to be admitted, so long as there is proof of the reliability of the process that produced the videotape evidence.

Concurrence
Justices Webster and Schemer concurred in the judgment, but did not write separately.

Under the “silent witness” theory, the court held, when a trial judge finds the evidence to be reliable, it is admissible.  The court pointed out that the trial judge should look to five factors in making such a determination, namely:
