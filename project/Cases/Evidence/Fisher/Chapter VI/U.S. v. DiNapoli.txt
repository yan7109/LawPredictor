Brief Fact Summary
Several Defendants were charged with violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) following an alleged bid-rigging scheme involving the concrete industry and skyscraper construction contracts in Manhattan.  At trial, when the prosecution attempted to introduce evidence of grand jury testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1), the lower court held that the “similar motive” requirement was not met and disallowed the testimony.  This appeal follows a remand from the United States Supreme Court.

Discussion
The court reasons that in determining whether the “similar motive” requirement of Rule 804(b)(1) is met, the court must consider:
