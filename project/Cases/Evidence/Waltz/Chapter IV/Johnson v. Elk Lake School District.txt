283 F.3d 138, 2002 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
The plaintiff, Betsy Sue Johnson (the “plaintiff”), sued her high school counselor and the school’s Administration, alleging the counselor sexually abused and harassed her over a two year period.  She claims the counselor sent her suggestive notes and letters, attempted to hug and kiss her, and fondled her.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Federal Rules of Evidence (”F.R.E.”) Rule 415 allows evidence of past sexual assaults to be introduced in civil cases when the claim for damages is based on the alleged sexual assault.

Facts
The plaintiff sued her high school counselor, Wayne Stevens (”Mr. Stevens”), claiming he sexually harassed and abused her.  She alleges that over a two year period he sent her letters, roses, cards, suggestive correspondence, attempted to hug and kiss her, and fondled her.  The plaintiff sued the defendants, Mr. Stevens and the Administration (the “defendants”), for violation of her civil rights and for conspiracy, negligence, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Issue
What is the standard for admitting evidence of prior sexual conduct?

Held
Chief Judge Becker issued the ruling of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (”Third Circuit”) in holding that a trial court may admit evidence of prior sexual assaults if the evidence is relevant in that a jury could reasonably conclude that the act was a sexual assault and was committed by the defendant.

Discussion
The Third Circuit concluded that the trial court actually engaged in a balancing exercise under F.R.E. Rule 403, wherein the evidence offered by Ms. Radwanski was excluded because its slight probative value was outweighed by other factors such as the danger of unfair prejudice, confusions of the issues, and waste of time.  The trial court continues to maintain the discretion to exclude this type of evidence even if it is relevant.
