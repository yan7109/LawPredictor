Facts
The defendant was striking Mr. Miller in the head with a pistol when the gun fired and killed Mr. Miller.  The defendant was indicted for two firearms violations and second degree murder.  During trial, the defendant admitted grabbing Mr. Miller and striking him with a gun, but claims the gun discharged accidentally.  The district court did not allow eyewitnesses or the investigating officer to offer their opinion that the discharge of the gun was accidental.<span class="heading">Issue.</span> Was it reversible error to exclude the testimony regarding whether the firing of the gun was accidental?

Held
Circuit Judge Cowen issued the opinion of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (”Third Circuit”) and found that while the district court did err in excluding the eyewitness testimony, such error did not prejudice the defendant.  Thus, the conviction is affirmed.

Discussion
The police officer’s opinion was properly excluded because he did not observe the assault, thus he did not have first hand knowledge.
