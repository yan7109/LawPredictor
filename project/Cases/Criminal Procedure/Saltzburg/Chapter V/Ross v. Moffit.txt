417 U.S. 600,94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341, 1974 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
This was a consolidated appeal of two separate cases in which indigent defendants were convicted in North Carolina trial courts. Both appealed and were represented by court appointed counsel before the North Carolina Court of Appeals.  Each defendant thereafter pursued other discretionary post conviction remedies and were denied court appointed counsel.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The same concepts of fairness and equality, which require counsel in a first appeal of right, require counsel in other and subsequent discretionary appeals.

Facts
This case is the result of the consolidation of two separate cases in which an indigent defendant was convicted in the trial court of the respective counties of Mecklenburg and Guilford, North Carolina.  Each defendant pursued his appeal of right to the North Carolina Court of Appeals, where each was represented by court appointed counsel. The convictions were affirmed.

Held
Neither the due process clause nor the equal protection clause require states to appoint counsel to indigent defendants in discretionary appeals or other post conviction relief.
