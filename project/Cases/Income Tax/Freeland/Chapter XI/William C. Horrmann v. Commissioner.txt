Issue
Is Petitioner entitled to a depreciation deduction?

Held
Judge Black issued the opinion for the Tax Court in holding that Petitioner is entitled to depreciation deductions.

Discussion
The Tax Court found that for issued one and two the deductions were allowed as Petitioner demonstrated that he had expended efforts in trying to rent and sell the property.  As far as the long term capital loss, that required the Petitioner to show that the property was converted into a transaction for profit.  However, after he acquired the property he converted the place into his personal residence.  Simply trying to rent or sell the property does not change its character.  Rather, Petitioner could have changed his mind at any moment subject to his will.
