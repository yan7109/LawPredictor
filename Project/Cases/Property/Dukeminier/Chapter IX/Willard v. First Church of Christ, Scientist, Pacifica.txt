7 Cal. 3d 473, 498 P.2d 987, 102 Cal. Rptr. 739, 1972 Cal.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiffs, Mr. and Mrs. Willard (Plaintiffs), sued to quiet title regarding an easement they did not believe existed on the property. The Defendant, First Church of Christ, Scientist, Pacifica (Defendant), contended that they were granted an easement, which was in the deed prior to the conveyance to the current owners.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A grantor may in a deed to real property, reserve an interest in that property for third parties.

Facts
Mrs. McGuigan owned two lots and permitted her church to use one of her lots for parking. Mrs. McGuigan sold the lot to Mr. Peterson who sold it to the Plaintiffs. There was an easement on the lot that the church used for parking, permitting the church to continue to use the lot for parking. The Plaintiffs were unaware of the easement, which was not on the deed. Plaintiffs filed an action to quiet title to the lot against the Church. The trial court entered judgment quieting title to the Plaintiffs. The Defendant appealed.

Issue
Whether a grantor may, in deeding real property to one person, reserve an interest in that property for a third party.

Held
Reversed. The court abandoned the old common law rule of rejecting conveyances that vest interests in third parties and held that in the case, such a reservation vests the interest in the third party.

Discussion
The court discussed why the old feudal rule of rejecting any reservation in land that vested rights in third parties was no longer applicable and in the end, frustrated the grantor’s intent. The court found that the grantor clearly intended to vest an interest in the property to the church and that the Plaintiffs were not at a bigger injustice with this decision to forego the old rule which would have rejected the conveyance to the church.
