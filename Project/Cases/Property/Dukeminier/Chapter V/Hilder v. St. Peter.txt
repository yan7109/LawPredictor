144 Vt. 150, 478 A.2d 202, 1984 Vt.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Hilder (Plaintiff), moved into to an apartment with substantial defects, some of which she repaired at her own cost. Plaintiff sued to recover paid rent and money spent to repair defects in apartment.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When the landlord breaches the implied warranty of habitability, tenant can withhold rent, repair defects and deduct this cost from rent payments, seek rent already paid, and seek punitive damages in the appropriate cases.

Facts
In October 1974, Plaintiff began occupying an apartment in the Defendants, the Mr. and Mrs. St. Peter’s (Defendants) complex. Plaintiff occupied the apartment pursuant to an oral lease and paid all rent due. Further per an oral agreement, Plaintiff cleaned the apartment in exchange for her security deposit back, which the Defendants denied receiving. Plaintiff discovered several defects and items in disrepair in her apartment. Some of which she fixed with her own funds. The trial court found that the state of disrepair constituted a breach of the implied warranty of habitability and reduced the value of the leasehold. Defendants appealed.

Issue
The Defendants raised three issues on appeal:

Held
Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded. Plaintiff is entitled to either withhold rent or seek damages in the amount of rent previously paid.

Discussion
The court went through the history of landlord tenant law and noted that in today’s modern society, the landlord is more familiar with the complex operations associated with apartment building maintenance and repair, while the tenant is at a disadvantage in bargaining power. The court also noted that punitive damages are appropriate in cases where the landlord’s behavior is willful and wanton or fraudulent.
