Brief Fact Summary
A migrant farm worker was discharged from his job and was not allowed to remain overnight at his employer’s barracks.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a landlord is also the tenant’s employer, and the housing is based on employment, the tenant must be given a reasonable time to find alternative housing before being evicted and must also be given a hearing before ejectment.

Facts
Glasboro Service Association, Inc. (Defendant) hires out migrant farm workers to farmers. Pursuant to a contract with the Puerto Rican Department of Labor, Defendant supplied living quarters for workers. Natividad Vasquez (Plaintiff) worked for Defendant but was discharged. Although there was vacant space in the living quarters, Plaintiff was not permitted to remain overnight. The Farmworkers Rights Project, a federally funded non-profit corporation dedicated to the needs of farm workers, filed a complaint seeking an order permitting Plaintiff to reenter his living quarters and enjoining Defendant from depriving him of the use of the quarters except through judicial process.

Issue
Are migrant farm workers who reside in living quarters provided by their employer entitled to a court hearing before being evicted?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Migrant farm workers often have a landlord-tenant as well as employer-employee relationship with their employers. They do not speak English, and their families do not reside in the United States. Since they present such a unique situation, they cannot be immediately evicted from their housing. They are entitled to some protection by the courts, which is done by a hearing.
