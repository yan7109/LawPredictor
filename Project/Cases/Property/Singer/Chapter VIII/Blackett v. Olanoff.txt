Brief Fact Summary
A landlord rented property to a tenant running a lounge in an area that was residential. The lease required the noise not disturb others, but when it did, the landlord did not correct the situation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A tenant’s implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is violated when the landlord leases property to another tenant, and the lease gives the landlord the right to control the level of noise, but the landlord does not prevent the undesirable conduct.

Facts
Landlords (Plaintiffs) leased a property to be used as a lounge in an area where they leased premises for residential purposes. A provision in the lease stated that the entertainment in the lounge had to be conducted in a way so that it could not be heard outside the building. The residential tenants (Defendants) objected to the noise, and when landlords complained, the lounge became quieter from time to time. The noise caused Defendants to move out. Plaintiffs brought suit for nonpayment of rent against Defendants, who raised the doctrine of constructive eviction. Judgment for Defendants.

Issue
When the acts of one tenant prevent the other tenants from enjoying their premises, will the landlord be liable when the lease prohibits the tenant from disturbing others?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The covenant of quiet enjoyment, which is implied in every landlord-tenant relationship, holds that the landlord promises not to disturb the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of his premises. As seen in this case, the landlord will be liable when the disturbance comes from another tenant.
