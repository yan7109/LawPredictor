114 So. 2d 357, 1959 Fla. App.

Brief Fact Summary
The construction of a new addition to a hotel will block sunlight from another hotel’s pool.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A landowner does not have a legal right to the free flow of light and air across the adjoining land of his neighbor.

Facts
The Fontainebleau Hotel began constructing a fourteen-story addition to the hotel. The Eden Roc Hotel is next to the Fontainebleau. When the new addition is complete, there will be a shadow of the addition over the cabana, swimming pool, and the sunbathing area of the Eden Roc during the winter. The Eden Roc is attempting to enjoin the construction because they claim the addition would interfere with the light and air on the beach in front of the Eden Roc and cast a shadow that will render the beach unusable.

Issue
Does a landowner have a right to unobstructed light and air from an adjoining land?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
The right to have one’s view remain unobstructed cannot be created by implication; otherwise, property development would be hindered.
