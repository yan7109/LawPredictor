514 U.S. 159, 115 S. Ct. 1300, 131 L. Ed. 2d 248, 1995 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
A company registered a color as a trademark.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There is no objection to the use of color alone as a trademark, when that color has attained a secondary meaning and therefore identifies and distinguishes a particular brand.

Facts
Qualitex Company (Petitioner) uses a special shade of green-gold for press pads that it sells to dry cleaning firms. Jacobson Products (Respondent) began to use the same color. Petitioner registered the color as a trademark and then added a trademark infringement count to an unfair competition claim in a lawsuit it had already filed against Petitioner for use of the color. The Lanham Act gives a seller or producer the exclusive right to register a trademark and to prevent competitors from using that trademark.

Issue
Can a color be a trademark?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The Lanham Act is broadly construed and so can include within its scope almost anything. The court focuses on what the color represents and how it is viewed by consumers, rather than on its status as a color.
