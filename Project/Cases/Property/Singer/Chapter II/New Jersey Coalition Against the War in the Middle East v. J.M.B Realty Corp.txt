Brief Fact Summary
Protestors against the Persian Gulf War requested permission to leaflet at malls and were denied access.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Regional shopping centers must permit leafleting on societal issues, subject to reasonable standards set by the centers.

Facts
The plaintiffs are a group that opposes military intervention in the Persian Gulf and they sought public support for their views. They sought to offer these views at several large regional and community shopping centers. A few of these malls denied plaintiff’s request to leaflet on their premises. The shopping centers permits and encourages non-shopping activities on its premises, including access for community groups, speech, politics and community issues.

Issue
Can the owner of a regional shopping center deny a group the right to enter the center and distribute leaflets?

Held
No.

Dissent
Merchants should not be required to provide a forum, place or occasion for speech. They are in business for business sake and are not instruments of the state. The purpose of a shopping mall is to shop, not to educate.

Discussion
States are entitled to provide more protection for free speech rights than that mandated by the federal constitution. So, even though the Supreme Court has not provided free speech rights to private shopping centers, a few states have interpreted their constitutions as providing such protection.
