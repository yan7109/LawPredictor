799 P.2d 304,1990 Alas.

Brief Fact Summary
During the statutory period, a couple lived on a piece of land and treated it as their own. Title was actually held by another party.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When one party possesses another’s property in a way that is exclusive, continuous, and without permission for a statutorily set period of time, title transfers to the adverse possessor and the owner will be barred from bringing an action of ejectment against the possessor.

Facts
The family of Charles Fagerstrom originally entered the disputed property around the mid 1940s. After Charles married in 1963, he and his wife intended to build a cabin on the north end of the property. Over the years, they moved more of their property and made improvements to the land. They were present on the property every other weekend and a few times a week. They cleaned the property, and others believed they owned it.

Issue
Can a person have adverse possession of property if they did not construct significant structures on it and was only present on the property seasonally?

Held
Yes. Judgment remanded.

Discussion
When the requirements of adverse possession are met, a trespasser is transformed into the owner, and the original owner will not be able to eject the adverse possessor.
