196 W. Va. 559,474 S.E.2d 489, 1996 W. Va.

Brief Fact Summary
A piece of land enclosed into one person’s property actually belonged to someone else. When the true owner attempted to build on that property, a claim of adverse possession was made.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Tacking is the adding together of periods of adverse possession, and is allowed when the transferor and transferee have privity with each other.

Facts
The Gobble family purchased a piece of property and were informed by their real estate agent that their property ran up to and included the fence. They used this property consistent with ownership rights. When the Browns purchased their property, a survey they had done showed that a fenced-in two feet wide tract of land that the Gobbles believed was theirs actually belonged to the Browns. At the time, the Browns did nothing to show ownership of that land. Five years later, the Browns decided to build a road on that land, but the Gobbles asserted ownership of the land. The trial court held the Gobbles failed to show ownership by adverse possession.

Issue
Can adverse possession be established by landowners by tacking on the time period of their predecessors in title?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed and remanded.

Discussion
When two parties have a direct relationship with each other, such as being parties to a deed, they are in privity. When privity exists, periods of adverse possession can be added together so the statutory time requirements can be met, which is called tacking.
