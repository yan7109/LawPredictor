Brief Fact Summary
An act by a city closed a street, which prevented blacks from driving through a white neighborhood.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When the closing of a public street does not have a direct effect on the property interests of a minority group, then there will be no civil rights violation.

Facts
The city closed one end of a street that crossed a white residential community. This prevented traffic from a black community from obtaining access to the street. The black residents challenged the street closing as violation of Section 1982 of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in buying or leasing real property.

Issue
When a street is closed and has the effect of somewhat restricting access to property in a minority neighborhood, will the closing be a violation of civil rights?

Held
No.

Dissent
The message of the street closing sent to black residents is that they are not allowed in a protected white neighborhood. The psychological effect of the barrier will be to reinforce the city’s favoritism toward whites and it will serve as a monument to racial hostility.

Discussion
When the effect of legislation only has an incidental effect on a minority group’s enjoyment of real property, the court will not find a violation of the civil rights act.
