892 F.2d 315, 1989 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
A battered women’s shelter was excluded from using a building because it violated a city ordinance.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When an ordinance is facially neutral and applies to all transitional dwellings, whether the residents are male or female, the Fair Housing Act will not be violated.

Facts
An organization wanted to use a building as a temporary shelter for abused women and children. The City Council (Defendant) denied their application because the use was not within the provisions of the city’s zoning ordinance as it limited transitional dwellings to six residents. The organization contends the ordinance is invalid under the Fair Housing Act (Act), which prohibits discrimination in housing, because it has a discriminatory effect on protected groups. The Act prohibits discrimination based on sex.

Issue
Do battered women’s shelters fall within the protection of the Fair Housing Act?

Held
No.

Dissent
The familial status provision refers only to single families, not to families who desire to live communally. There is nothing in the language of the Act to support the idea that the Act is intended to extend protection to families who wish to live in groups.

Discussion
A group home that is excluded because of a city ordinance will not be protected by the Act if the group is defined by sex. Both men and women could be affected equally by the ordinance, so no discrimination based on sex exists.
