Brief Fact Summary
A party was unaware that her signature was forged in order to sell a house. She seeks to have the house returned to her, after it was bought first by a realty company with knowledge of the forgery and then by a couple with no knowledge of the forgery.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a deed is forged, the property will revert back to the original innocent property owner, even if that owner allows a long time to pass before instituting a suit.

Facts
Martin (Appellant) and Lester Fletcher held residential property in joint tenancy. Appellant contracted with Jack Spicer Real Estate, Inc. (Spicer) for sale of the property. The purported signatures of Appellant and Fletcher appeared on the deed. Appellant never actually signed the contract or lease. Fletcher had had a clerk forge Appellant’s signature. Spicer contracted to sell the property to William and Marie Carter (Appellees). Appellant discovered the forged sales contract. Fletcher admitted the forgery. Appellant contacted Spicer and stated she never signed the conveyance. For financial reasons, Appellant did not take legal action to pursue the issue. Spicer conveyed the property in fee simple to Appellees. Appellees had no knowledge of Appellant’s interest in the property. They improved the property. Twenty-three months after discovering the forgery, Appellant filed suit to have the property returned to her.

Issue
When a deed is forged, is it an unreasonable delay to let twenty-three months pass between the time a forged contract for conveyance of property was discovered and the time suit was filed, if the party notified the buyer of the property as soon as she discovered the forgery?

Held
No.

Discussion
Forged deeds are void and transfer no interest to a grantee. A bona fide purchaser who buys in reliance on the appearance of good title from the grantee will receive nothing.
