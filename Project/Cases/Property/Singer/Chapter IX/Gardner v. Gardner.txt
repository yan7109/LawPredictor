454 N.W.2d 361, 1990 Iowa Sup.

Brief Fact Summary
Two brothers conveyed their interest in land to another brother for him to use as security for a loan. He did not re-convey their interest when the loan was denied.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a party partially performs under an oral agreement, the statute of frauds will not be a valid defense. Parol evidence may be used to establish the agreement.

Facts
Harry Gardner (Defendant) was in debt and needed security for a loan. His brothers, Mark and James Gardner (Plaintiffs) conveyed their interest in real estate to him by quitclaim deed, which did not mention an agreement to re-convey. According to Plaintiffs, Defendant told them he would re-convey the interest if the refinancing fell through. The loan was denied, and when Plaintiffs asked for the interest, Defendant refused to return it.

Issue
When a party partially performs under an oral agreement, will the statute of frauds bar the introduction of evidence of an oral contract?

Held
No.

Discussion
The statute of frauds will not apply when there has been part performance on the oral contract because of the performing parties’ reliance.
