Brief Fact Summary
An American Indian group sought compensation for a taking by the federal government of forest timber from a piece of land used by the group.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The taking or use of American Indian land does not require any compensation by the government.

Facts
The Tee-Hit-Tons are a group of American Indians who reside in Alaska. They claims to have a full proprietary ownership, or in the alternative, a recognized right to unrestricted possession, of land within the Tongass National Forest, located in Alaska because their tribal predeccesors have continuously occupied the land. The government sold timber from the forest, and the Tee-Hit-Tons claimed a right to compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The government denies that the group has any compensable interest in the land; their right to the land is solely from the government’s will.

Issue
Do Native Americans have any permanent right to land they occupy by the permission of the government?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Because American Indians do not have any constitutional right to own the land they live on, they have no right to compensation when the government uses the land.
