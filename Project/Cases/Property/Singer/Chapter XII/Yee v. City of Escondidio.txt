Brief Fact Summary
An ordinance on mobile home parks limited the amount of rent that could be charged, and owners of parks claim the ordinance is a physical occupation of their property.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a landlord decides to rent his land to tenants, the government may place regulations on the rent the landowner can charge without automatically having to pay compensation.

Facts
John and Irene Yee (Petitioners) own a mobile home park in the city of Escondido. The city adopted a rent control ordinance, which set rents back to 1986 levels, and prohibits increases without the approval of the city council. Park owners may apply to the Council for rent increases at any time, and the Council must approve any increases it determines to be just, fair and reasonable. Petitioners contend that the ordinance amounts to a physical occupation of their property entitling them to compensation.

Issue
Does a rent control regulation on a mobile home park amount to a taking?

Held
No.

Discussion
When the government merely regulates the use of property, compensation will usually not be required, unless the regulation has unfairly singled out the property owner.
