Brief Fact Summary
A bible camp attempted to limit the people who buy their property to those who subscribe to the tenets of their church.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a grantor transfers land in fee simple to the grantee, the grantor cannot prohibit the grantee from conveying land to another. Any clause in the deed which gives grantor the right to approve subsequent purchasers will be void.

Facts
Washington Bible Camp (Defendant) owns land which was subdivided and sold only to people who agreed to subscribe to the tenets of the Assembly of God Church. George Riste (Plaintiff) had parents who bought property from Defendant. After the contract was paid in full, his surviving parent asked Defendant to issue the deed to Plaintiff. The deed given to Plaintiff contained restrictions on occupancy and resale, one of which was a direct restraint on alienation of land. Another restriction dealt with the religious beliefs of Defendant. Defendant refused to remove the restrictions from the deed.

Issue
May a deed place a direct restraint on alienation of land, even though grantor transferred a fee simple estate to grantee?

Held
No.

Discussion
An absolute restraint on alienation of land is repugnant to the nature of a fee simple interest and will be voided.
