372 P.2d 647 (Nev. 1962)

Brief Fact Summary
An easement is the only existing ingress and egress into an 80 acre tract of land. One landowner wants to widen the road, the other wants to keep it undeveloped.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The size of an appurtenant easement is determined by the intent of the grantor.

Facts
Henry Quill obtained the Quill Easement from the Glenbrook Company, which gave him use of the roads on Glenbrook Company’s property. After Quill’s death, his property was sold, and came into the hands of Cox and Detrick. Cox and Detrick (Plaintiffs) plan to divide into approximately 40 parcels to build homes. The Quill Easement is the only existing ingress and egress form the tract. Glenbrook Company (Defendant) has a resort business, which has a quiet atmosphere that the company wants to maintain. Plaintiffs want to widen the road used by Quill.

Issue
When an easement appurtenant grants a right of way, will the easement be violated if the intent of the original parties is not followed?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
Appurtenant easements benefit the entire dominant estate and so will be apportionable among subsequent owners when the dominant estate is divided.
