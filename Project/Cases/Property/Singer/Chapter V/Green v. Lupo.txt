32 Wn. App. 318, 647 P.2d 51, 1982 Wash. App.

Brief Fact Summary
A couple sold a portion of their land and obtained a promise of an easement over a part of it. The other couple refused to formally grant the easement as promised.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When the benefit runs with the land, it is attached to that particular parcel of land and is called an appurtenant easement.

Facts
The Greens (Plaintiffs) owned a tract of land. The Lupos (Defendants) bought their parcel of land (the north tract) from Plaintiffs. While they were still paying for that land, Defendants requested a deed release to a small section of the north tract to allow financing for the construction of a home. Plaintiffs agreed in return for a promise of an easement along the north tract when Defendants eventually obtained title. The parties entered into a writing about the easement, but it did not state whether the easement was in gross or appurtenant. But when Defendants obtained title, they refused to grant the easement. Plaintiffs brought an action for specific performance.

Issue
When an easement is granted for the purposes of ingress, egress and utility, will that be evidence of intent to create an appurtenant easement?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed and remanded.

Discussion
Appurtenant easements can only be enforced by the person who owns the dominant estate, and so cannot be sold separately from the land.
