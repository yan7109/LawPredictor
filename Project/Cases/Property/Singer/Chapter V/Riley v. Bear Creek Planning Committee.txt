17 Cal. 3d 500, 551 P.2d 1213, 131 Cal. Rptr. 381, 1976 Cal.

Brief Fact Summary
A couple attempted to make improvements to their property in violation of a development restriction that was made after the couple purchased their land.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A restriction that is not recorded at the time of the purchase will not be enforceable against the purchaser, even if the purchaser orally promised to be bound by the restrictions.

Facts
The Rileys (Plaintiffs) bought real property in a subdivision on February 26, 1964. The deed contained no restrictions on the use of the property. Nine months after the purchase, the grantor, Bear Creek Planning Committee (Defendants) recorded a document that declared covenants, conditions and restrictions on all the lots in the subdivision. One of the restrictions prohibited adding new structures without approval of Defendants. Plaintiffs constructed a snow tunnel on their lot and Defendants claimed it to be a violation.

Issue
When a lot is purchased with an unrestricted deed and there are no references to restrictions in the chain of title, can the doctrine of implied reciprocal negative servitudes be applied to the unrestricted lot?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Dissent
Plaintiffs took their deed with the understanding that the lot was subject to valid restrictions. Plaintiffs thus purchased the land with actual knowledge of the restrictions, and those restrictions increased the value of Plaintiffs lot because all the other property owners in the subdivision are bound by them. Plaintiffs should not be allowed to ignore the restrictions, and the extrinsic evidence should be admitted to establish the existence of the restrictions.

Discussion
If restrictions to a subdivision are recorded after a deed has already been given to a purchaser, those restrictions will not be enforceable against the purchaser, even if the purchaser may have had notice of them.
