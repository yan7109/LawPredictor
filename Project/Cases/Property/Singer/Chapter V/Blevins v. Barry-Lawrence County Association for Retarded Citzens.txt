707 S.W.2d 407, 1986 Mo.

Brief Fact Summary
An association wanted to establish a group home for unrelated mentally retarded persons. A neighbor claimed the use would violate a covenant in the neighborhood.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Property restricted to a single or double family dwelling refers to an architectural style rather than the relationship between the people in the residence, so unrelated people can live together without violating a restrictive covenant. Further, a group home is a residential, not commercial use of property.

Facts
The Barry-Lawrence County Association for Retarded Citizens (Appellant) wanted to establish a group home for eight unrelated mentally retarded persons. A restrictive covenant in the neighborhood limits the residences to single or double family dwellings and limits the use to residential purposes only. The Blevins (Respondents) claim that the use intended by Appellants will violate the covenant.

Issue
Is running a group home for unrelated people a residential purpose that can be considered a single or double family dwelling?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
When a restrictive covenant is ambiguous, courts often interpret it broadly if doing so will further a socially useful policy.
