452 S.W.2d 153,1970 Mo.

Brief Fact Summary
The inheritance of property is conditioned on a person remaining unmarried, and that person seeks a fee title to the real estate.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
All devisees take in fee simple if no intent is expressed to create a life estate only and no further devise is made to take effect after the death of the devisee.

Facts
A will was created which devised to Hattie L. Lewis (Plaintiff) real estate as long as she remained unmarried. If she did marry, the will provided that the property would be divided equally between Plaintiff, a niece and a nephew. The nephew died leaving two sons, who have contested Plaintiff’s suit. Forty-three years after the will was probated, Plaintiff was still unmarried and has been in continuous possession of the real estate. She brought a suit to gain title in fee simple determinable. The two sons claim she only has a life estate determinable.

Issue
When real property is devised, does the testator intend to create a fee simple determinable when the will does not mention a life estate conveyance and the will indicates no further devise after the death of the devisee?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The court seems to favor granting a fee estate rather than a life estate when the will does not have a clear intent to transfer property at less than a fee est
