6 Kan. App. 2d 94,627 P.2d 831, 1981 Kan. App.

Brief Fact Summary
The estate of a life estate holder of a farm and farmhouse is sued on the theory of waste to recover damages for the deterioration of the farmhouse.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A life tenant has a duty to keep the property in reasonable repair so as to prevent decay or waste.

Facts
Ada C. Brennan inherited a life estate in farmland and a farmhouse, which had a remainder interest to Dorothy Moore and Kent Reinhardt (Plaintiffs). Brennan did not live in the house. Eleven years after she died, Plaintiffs filed a demand against her estate on the theory of waste to recover damages for the deterioration of the farmhouse. The estate defended on grounds of laches or estoppel, the statute of limitations, and abandonment. The district magistrate only sustained the defense of laches or estoppel, but ruled they were not applicable to the case and found for the remaindermen. The estate appeals.

Issue
When remaindermen wait eleven years after the death of the life tenant before filing a claim or demand against the life tenant for neglect, are they barred by laches or estoppel?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Remaindermen have the right to receive their property in reasonable repair. A life tenant cannot use property in a way that injures the rights of remaindermen.
