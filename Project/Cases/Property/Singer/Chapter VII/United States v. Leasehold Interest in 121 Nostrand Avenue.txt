760 F. Supp. 1015, 1991 U.S. Dist.

Brief Fact Summary
A member of a large household sold drugs, and under a federal statute, the government attempted to evict the entire household.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A defense to the drug forfeiture statutes is the innocent owner defense, which allows the claimant to retain the property if he or she can establish lack of knowledge of narcotics activity or that there was no consent to the activity.

Facts
A great-grandmother, Mrs. Clara Smith, lived with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren in an apartment. The family lives in poverty, but they are better off in the apartment than on the streets or in shelters. An undercover police officer purchased drugs from one of her granddaughters. A search of the house was conducted, and police found crack and determined the home was used to store drugs. The civil drug forfeiture statute creates an in rem cause of action for violations of narcotics laws. It allows the government, on finding a sufficient nexus between drug activity and the property itself, to obtain forfeiture of the property. Forfeiture is warranted if the property is used to make drug activity easier. The government seeks to evict Mrs. Smith and her family from their home under this statute.

Issue
If an owner does not know of narcotics activity taking place on her property and would not give consent to the activity had she known, can that owner be evicted from her property under the drug forfeiture statute?

Held
No.

Discussion
The purpose of the innocent owner defense is to protect family members who have nothing to do with the narcotics crime. The court believes that most drug users are from poor neighborhoods, so evicting an entire family for the wrongdoing of one person would be against the welfare of the poor, because they would end up living in the streets or in shelters.
