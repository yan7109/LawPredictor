22 Ill.79 Ariz. 126, 285 P.2d 168 (1955)

Brief Fact Summary
A telephone company brought an action against property owners and a contractor (Kelton) for damage to an underground cable laid across land under a perpetual easement, which had been duly recorded. The property owners were found negligent in failing to take proper precautions.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The court cited the Pennsylvania case of Maul v. Rider, 59 Pa. 167, which held that, “It is sometimes said that the record of a deed is constructive notice to all the world. That, it is evident, is too broad and unqualified an enunciation of the doctrine. It is constructive notice only to those who are bound to search for it.” [emphasis added in original].
