Brief Fact Summary
Replevin action where Plaintiff owned land upon which a meteorite fell and was recovered by a third party accompanied by Plaintiff’s lessee and sold to Defendant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Whatever is affixed to the soil is a part of the soil and no one may take such items away without the consent of the property owner.

Facts
Plaintiff Goddard owned prairie land which was leased to Elickson upon which, during the term of the lease, a meteorite fell. Elickson accompanied Hoagland, a neighboring land owner, who dug up the 66 pound meteorite valued at $101.00. Thereafter, Hoagland sold the meteorite to Defendant Winchell, who was aware that the meteorite had fallen south of Hoagland’s land. Plaintiff filed a Writ of Replevin in the District Court to have the Court order the meteorite returned. The District Court ruled that the meteorite became a part of the soil upon which it fell to a depth of 3 feet and thus belonged to the Plaintiff.

Issue
Is the meteorite a part of the land upon which it falls and thus owned by the owner of such land, or is the meteorite a movable object which if unclaimed belongs to any person who might claim it?

Held
The meteorite becomes a part of the soil upon which it falls, and cannot be removed without the permission of the owner of the land. Affirmed.

Discussion
This case involves a situation where Hoagland found the meteorite and dug it up. In a case such as this the Court held that discovery of the meteorite was not sufficient to acquire title. Also, note that due to Hoagland being accompanied by the tenant there was no trespass.
