22 Ill.25 Ill. 2d 447, 185 N.E.2d 218 (1962)

Brief Fact Summary
Mrs. Shay was in the process of selling four tracts of land under installment contracts when she died intestate and an action for partition was taken. The trial court denied partition based on the doctrine of equitable conversion. An appeal was taken.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When the owner of land enters into a valid and enforceable contract for its sale he continues to hold the legal title, but in trust for the buyer. The buyer becomes the equitable owner and holds the purchase money in trust for the seller/ owner.

Facts
Mrs. Shay was in the process of selling four tracts of land under installment contracts when she died intestate, and her husband and other heirs instituted an action for partition of the parcels based on their succession to Mrs. Shay’s interests. The trial court denied partition based on the doctrine of equitable conversion. An appeal was taken.

Issue
What interest, if any, do the successors of Mrs. Shay have in the property, which was sold under an installment contract?

Held
Not an ownership interest. Order affirmed.

Discussion
This case provides an excellent description of the equitable conversion doctrine. The doctrine is based on an equitable maxim and it is easy to see how the maxim protects the buyer from inequitable results in case of the death of the seller, especially in cases where the buyer is not in default at the time of death.
