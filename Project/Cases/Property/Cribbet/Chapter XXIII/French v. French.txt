Discussion
Clearly the facts suggested the following scenario: First, the Defendant grants the Plaintiff the deed to the lands, including the portion, which the Defendant lived on. Secondly, the Plaintiff gave a statutorily ineffective conveyance of a life estate back to the Defendant. Thirdly, the Plaintiff challenged the validity of the life estate in favor of Defendant. The court found that the consideration for the first transfer was based on blood. The statute of uses is an equitable solution to the statutory problems of the second transfer.
