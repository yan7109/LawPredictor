44 F.3d 553

Brief Fact Summary
Jancik, Petitioner, owns an apartment building, and ran an ad in a newspaper which was claimed by the Leadership Council for Metropolitan Open Communities to violate provisions of the Fair Housing Act (FHA).

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The FHA is violated where an ad for housing suggests to an ordinary reader that a particular group is preferred or dispreferred for the housing in question, which may be proven by subjective evidence of the intent of the person who places the ad.

Facts
Petitioner Jancik owns Building No. 44 in King Arthur’s Court, a large housing complex in Chicago.

Held
Yes. Petition for review denied.

Discussion
In this case, the court applied an objective test focussed on the content of the ad and looked to the conduct of Jancik in his conversations to provide the basis for their decision.
