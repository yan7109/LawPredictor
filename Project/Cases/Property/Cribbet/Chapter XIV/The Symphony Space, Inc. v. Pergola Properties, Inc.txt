Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, the Symphony Space, Inc. (Plaintiff), seeks to have a commercial option contract declared void because it vests beyond the 21-year perpetuity period.

The trial court concluded that the rule against perpetuities applied to the commercial option contained in the parties agreement and that the option violated the rule.
