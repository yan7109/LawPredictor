475 U.S. 1045; 106 S. Ct. 1260;89 L. Ed. 2d 570; 1986 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant, a non-tenured teacher, brought suit claiming that the failure of the school to recommend the renewal of her teaching contract was based upon her impending divorce in violation of her constitutional rights of privacy and liberty.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
It is a violation of appellant’s constitutional right to privacy and liberty to deny public employment on the basis of her impending divorce.

Facts
Appellant, Linda Littlejohn, was a non-tenured teacher.  She had good evaluations for the two years she taught, and was described by her principle as an excellent student.  Under Kentucky law, non-tenured teachers are automatically re-hired for the following school year unless they received written notice to the contrary by April 30.  Appellant’s school system could not determine its hiring needs for the next school year by April 30, so to avoid automatic renewal it would notify the non-tenured teachers that their contracts would not be renewed.  During the summer, the superintendent would recommend the appropriate number of non-tenured teachers for rehire.

Issue
Could the school constitutionally deny public employment without sufficient justification?

Held
No.  A person’s involvement in activity shielded by the constitutionally protected rights of privacy and liberty constitutes an impermissible reason for denying employment.

Discussion
The school violated appellant’s constitutional rights to liberty and privacy if the evidence sufficiently proved that her employment was not renewed due to her impending divorce.
