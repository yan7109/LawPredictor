623 A.2d 1095,1993 Del.

Brief Fact Summary
A 66 year old adult attempted to adopt his 51 year old companion for estate and tax purposes.  The Family Court denied the petition because there was no preexisting parent-child relationship.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There is a general disinclination to examine the motives for adult adoption outside of common sense limitations that are provided for in the Law’s grant of discretion.

Facts
Richard Sorrels, age 66, sought to adopt James Swanson, age 51, his companion of 17 years.  The purposes of the adoption were to formalize a close emotional relationship and to facilitate their estate planning.  They sought to prevent collateral claims on their respective estates from remote family members, and to obtain the reduced inheritance tax rate which natural and adopted children enjoy under Delaware law.  The Family Court denied the petition on the grounds that there was no pre-existing parent-child relationship between them.

Issue
Did the Family Court err as a matter of law in formulating or applying legal principles when it interpreted the Domestic Relations Law to require a preexisting parent-child relationship?

Held
Although the Law confers reasonable discretion on the Family Court’s approval of an adult adoption, the Family Court erred in requiring a preexisting parent-child relationship.

Discussion
The Law provided some discretion by providing that the Family Court may grant the adoption.  However, the Court found that the Family Court had overstepped its boundaries by finding a requirement of a preexisting family relationship.
