398 So. 2d 686,1981 Ala.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellee was given custody of her two children during a custody hearing based solely on the Alabama tender years presumption.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The tender years presumption fails scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment by placing an evidentiary burden on fathers that is not placed on mothers.

Facts
Appellant Christopher Devine and appellee Alice Beth Clark Devine were married in 1966 and separated in Alabama in 1979.  They had two sons, Mathew and Timothy.  Mrs. Devine taught high school until 1975, when she commenced employment with the U.S. army as an Education Specialist.  Appellant was a member of the faculty and head of the Guidance Counseling Department at Jacksonville State University.  At the time of the custody hearing the older son had just completed the first grade at the University and the younger son was enrolled at the University’s Nursery Laboratory School.  The trial court awarded custody of both boys to the mother based on the tender years presumption.

Issue
Did the trial court’s reliance on the tender years presumption deprive the father of his constitutional entitlement to the equal protection of the law?

Held
The tender years presumption represents an unconstitutional gender-based classification which discriminates between fathers and mothers in child custody proceedings solely on the basis of sex.

Discussion
The case presents a summary of the former paternal preferences in custody decisions, which helps in the explanation of why a maternal preference must be scrutinized under the Fourteenth Amendment.
