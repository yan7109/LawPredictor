1999 ND 149,598 N.W.2d 131,1999 N.D.

Brief Fact Summary
At a custody hearing, both parents (Coreen and Kurt) presented evidence of domestic violence.  The court awarded custody of the marital child to Coreen.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
North Dakota law creates a rebuttable presumption against awarding custody to a parent who has perpetrated domestic violence when the court found credible evidence that domestic violence has occurred if it is a pattern of domestic violence or involves serious bodily injury.

Facts
Coreen and Kurt married in 1992, with a daughter, Morgan, being born one month later.  The parties separated in 1994, with an interim order issued by the district court allowing Coreen, Morgan and Bryson, Coreen’s son from a previous marriage, to live in the marital home.  At a custody hearing in 1998 both parties presented evidence of domestic violence.  Coreen presented testimony of three incidents of domestic violence, while Kurt presented evidence of one incidence of Coreen committing domestic violence.  The district court awarded custody of Morgan to Coreen and ordered Kurt to pay spousal and child support.  Kurt appealed claiming that the custody determination is erroneous because the Court incorrectly analyzed the evidence concerning domestic violence.

Issue
Did the court err in determining that allegations of Kurt committing domestic violence created a presumption against awarding custody while allegations of Coreen committing domestic violence did not?

Held
The trial court did not err in determining that Kurt’s allegations included repeated domestic violence and serious bodily injury, while Coreen’s did not.

Discussion
The court’s discussion demonstrates how domestic violence may be considered even when in does not directly relate to the best interests of the child.  In this case the court found that Coreen’s one alleged incident of domestic violence was insufficient to trigger the presumption.
