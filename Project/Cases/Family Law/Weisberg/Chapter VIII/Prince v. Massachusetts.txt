321 U.S. 158, 64 S. Ct. 438,88 L. Ed. 645,1944 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant appeals a conviction for violating Massachusetts’ child labor laws based upon her permitting her children to preach and sell pamphlets relating to the Jehovah Witness religion on the streets in the evening.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The state’s interest in protecting children through the child labor laws overrides the parent’s constitutional right to raise her children and the children’s constitutional right to practice religion as they choose.

Facts
Appellant Sarah Prince was the mother of two young sons and had legal custody of her niece.  Appellant as well as her children are Jehovah’s Witnesses.  They would distribute “Watchtower” and “Consolation” each week on the streets.  She had allowed the children to do so previously, and had been warned against doing so by the school attendance officer.  On December 18, 1941, she allowed the children to accompany her for the first time in the evening to distribute “Watchtower” and “Consolation” and engage in preaching work.  The pamphlets were sold for five cents each, but no one accepted a copy from the niece or her aunt that evening.  Appellant appeals a resulting conviction for violating Massachusetts’ child labor laws.

Issue
Does the freedom of religion of the First Amendment, and the parental rights secured by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibit Massachusetts from enforcing the child labor law based upon these facts?

Held
The State’s authority to prevent child labor overrides the constitutional protections in this case.

Discussion
The Court acknowledges the parent’s right to raise her children and the child’s right to practice religion as she chooses, but find that the state’s interest in protecting children validates the child labor laws in this case.
