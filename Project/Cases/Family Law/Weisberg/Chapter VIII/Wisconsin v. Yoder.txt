406 U.S. 205,92 S. Ct. 1526,32 L. Ed. 2d 15,1972 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Several Amish families appealed a decision convicting them of failing to send their children to school until the age of 16 based upon Freedom of Religion under the constitution.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The law compelling parents to send their children to public school until the age of 16 is unconstitutional as applied because it impermissibly interferes with the Amish religious beliefs.

Facts
Respondents Jonas Yoder, Wallace Miller, and Adin Yutzy are members of the Amish religion.  Wisconsin’s compulsory school-attendance law required them to cause their children to attend public or private school until they reach 16.  Respondents declined to send their children to public school after completion of the eighth grade.  Respondents were convicted of violating the law and fined $5 each.

Issue
Did the application of the compulsory attendance law violate respondent’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution?

Held
The application of the law is unconstitutional as applied to the Amish.

Dissent
The majority assumes that the interests at stake are only those of the parents and the State.  The children also have a legitimate interest in their education.  The inevitable effect of the decision is to impose the parents’ notions of religious duty upon their children.  It is the future of the student, not the parents, that is imperiled by today’s decision.  The views of the two children in question were not canvassed, and should be on remand.

Discussion
The majority’s decision did not determine that the statute would violate Constitutional rights if the children wanted to pursue further education, but found that such a decision was unnecessary because no such claim was made on the record.  The dissent suggested that the cause should be remanded to determine the desire of the children.
