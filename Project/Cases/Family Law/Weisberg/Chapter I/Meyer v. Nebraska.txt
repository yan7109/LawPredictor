Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff was convicted for teaching a child German under a Nebraska statute that outlawed the teaching of foreign languages to students that had not yet completed the eighth grade.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from creating legislation that restricts liberty interests when the legislation is not reasonably related to an acceptable state objective.

Facts
Plaintiff was convicted for teaching a child German under a Nebraska statute that outlawed the teaching of foreign languages to students that had not yet completed the eighth grade.  The Supreme Court of Nebraska upheld the conviction.

Issue
Does the statute as construed and applied unreasonably infringe on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment?

Held
The statute as applied is unconstitutional because it infringes on the liberty interests of the plaintiff and fails to reasonably relate to any end within the competency of the state.

Discussion
Liberty interests may not be interfered with by the states when the interference is arbitrary and not reasonably related to a purpose which the state may permissively regulate.
