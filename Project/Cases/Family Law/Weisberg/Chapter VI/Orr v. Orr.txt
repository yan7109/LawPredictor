Citation
440 U.S. 268,99 S. Ct. 1102,59 L. Ed. 2d 306,1979 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant alleged that Alabama’s alimony statute was unconstitutional because it provided that husbands, but not wives, may be required to pay alimony upon divorce.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The Alabama statute is unconstitutional because it is not rationally related to the legitimate state objectives proposed for the statute.

Facts
William, appellant, and Linda Orr, appellee, were issued a final decree of divorce on February 26, 1974, with appellant ordered to pay appellee $1,240 per month in alimony.  On July 28, 1976, appellee initiated a contempt proceeding against appellant alleging he was in arrears in his alimony payments.  Appellant alleged in his defense that Alabama’s alimony statute should be declared unconstitutional.

Issue
Is Alabama’s alimony statute, which provides that husbands, but not wives, may be required to pay alimony upon divorce constitutional?

Held
Such statutes are unconstitutional in situations such as this where the State’s compensatory and ameliorative purposes are as well served by gender-neutral classification as one that gender classifies.

Discussion
The Court found that the statute was not rationally related to the objectives because little if any additional burden would be placed on the state by providing help for needy males as well as needy females.
