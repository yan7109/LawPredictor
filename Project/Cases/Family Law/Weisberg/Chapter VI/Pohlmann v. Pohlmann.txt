703 So. 2d 1121,1997 Fla. App.

Brief Fact Summary
A former husband unsuccessfully petitioned to reduce his child support obligation, alleging that such a modification was justified by changed circumstances, including a permanent decrease in his income, his remarriage and his three children from this marriage, and his former wife’s remarriage.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Child Support Guidelines providing that the issue of subsequent children may only be raised in a proceeding for an upward modification of an existing award and may not be applied to justify a decrease in an existing awarded are not unconstitutional based on the rational basis standard.

Facts
A former husband unsuccessfully petitioned to reduce his child support obligation, alleging that such a modification was justified by changed circumstances, including a permanent decrease in his income, his remarriage and his three children from this marriage, and his former wife’s remarriage.  He appeals.

Issue
Did the trial court err in finding that the Child Support Guidelines were constitutional and that he failed to demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances.

Held
The trial court correctly determined that the Guidelines were constitutional and husband failed to demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances.

Dissent
The legitimate state interest in question is the preference of certain children over others.  It is inappropriate for the state to punish the children of a second marriage because their parent was involved in a previous divorce.  This discourages parents from having a second family, and there is no legitimate state purpose in discriminating between children on the fact of a divorce.

Discussion
The majority found that guidelines were rationally related to the legitimate state interest in assuring that noncustodial parents continue to provide for the children of their first marriage.
