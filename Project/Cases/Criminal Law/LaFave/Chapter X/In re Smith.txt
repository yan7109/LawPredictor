3 Cal. 3d 192,474 P.2d 969, 90 Cal. Rptr. 1,1970 Cal.

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant appealed two convictions based on the contention that his actions did not meet the standard for attempted kidnapping.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
To constitute an attempt, there must the specific intent to commit a particular crime, and a direct ineffectual act done towards its commission.

Facts
Defendant Smith was convicted and imprisoned for two counts of kidnapping, one count of attempted kidnapping and one count of rape. The convictions were based on three separate incidents with different women. One victim he raped. The other two, he attempted to have intercourse with but they managed to escape. Defendant appeals and contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Specifically that he was not guilty of attempted kidnapping and that his counsel did not raise appropriate argument.

Issue
Whether Defendant’s actions went beyond mere preparation and constituted an attempt.

Held
Vacated, Defendant is entitled to new counsel.

Discussion
The Court focused on the actions Defendant undertook with respect to the two women he was charged with attempting to kidnap. One woman testified that Defendant told her to unlock the car and that “we were going in my car.” The Court ruled that Defendant could have had the intent to rob or rape the woman and not to kidnap her. Thus Defendants actions did not reach the stage of development beyond mere preparation.
