435 U.S. 975, 98 S. Ct. 1623, 56 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1978)

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant was arrested for robbery and committed to State care until he is competent to stand trial. Appellant’s representative argued that he would never be competent and thus would be committed forever in violation of his constitutional rights.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If a defendant is deemed never competent to stand trial, the State must institute a civil commitment preceding that it would institute for any other citizen or release the defendant.

Facts
Appellant was a mentally deficient deaf mute with a mental level of a pre-school child. He could not read, write or communicate. Appellant was charged with robbery of two different women. Appellant robbed the women for four and five dollars respectively. Appellant was found to be incompetent to stand trial at an incompetency hearing. The Court ordered Appellant to be committed until he was competent to stand trial.

Issue
Whether Appellant’s Constitutional rights were violated.

Held
Reversed and Remanded.

Discussion
In determining whether Appellant was denied equal protection under the Constitution, the Court focused on the testimony of medical experts which determined that Appellant would never be competent to stand trial. Therefore, Appellant’s commitment was, in effect, permanent. The Court next addressed whether the charges against Appellant should be dismissed. This would depend on whether the Court determines that Appellant was capable of a criminal intent at the time of the crimes. If he was not, dismissal of the charges might be warranted.
