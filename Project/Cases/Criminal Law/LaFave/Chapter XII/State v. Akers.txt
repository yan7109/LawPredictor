Brief Fact Summary
The State sought to impose vicarious criminal liability on the parents of minors who drove snowmobiles in violation of state a statute.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Any attempt to impose liability on the parents simply because they are parents without more, violates the due process clause of the state constitution.

Facts
The Defendants, Akers and others (Defendants), are fathers of children who drove snowmobiles in violation of statute. The State charged the Defendants with vicarious criminal responsibility for the actions of their children.

Issue
Whether parents of minors can be held criminally accountable for their children’s offenses on the basis of their parental status.

Held
Parents cannot be held criminally responsible vicariously for the offenses of their children.

Dissent
The Dissent focused on the argument that the parents could be viewed as negligently allowing the children to operate the snowmobile, which could be sufficient to impose vicarious criminal responsibility. The Dissent noted that there is a public interest in promoting the safe operation of snowmobiles.

Discussion
The court started by reviewing the statute and determining that there was no specific language imposing vicarious liability on the Defendants. To impose liability on the parents, the court ruled, the state legislature must be specific in the acts/omissions that would impose the liability. Because no specificity in this statute was found, no liability could be imposed.
