501 S.W.2d 826,1973 Tenn. Crim. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant was charged with a crime against nature when he performed cunnilingus on the victim without her consent.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under Tennessee law, cunnilingus is considered a punishable crime against nature.

Facts
Defendant Locke was charged and convicted of committing a “crime against nature” against Minnie R. Rogers. It was alleged that Locke entered the apartment of his neighbor Mrs. Rogers late at night on the pretext of using the telephone, presented a butcher knife, and forced Mrs. Rogers to submit to two episodes of cunnilingus.

Issue
Is cunnilingus included within Tennessee’s “crime against nature” statute?

Held
Yes, conviction affirmed.

Dissent
To hold that cunnilingus, an act approved by almost 90% of adults between 18 and 34, is a crime would seem to be judicial legislation of the plainest kind.

Discussion
The Majority bases its decision on the fact that the Supreme Court of Tennessee had previously found that fellatio was included within “crimes against nature.” The Majority uses a broader definition than just sodomy, and includes all acts of unnatural copulation.
