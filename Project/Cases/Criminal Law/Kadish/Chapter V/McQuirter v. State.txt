Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, McQuirter (Defendant) a black man, was convicted of attempted rape. The Defendant was witnessed by a white woman following her down a road. After his arrest, the Defendant also allegedly confessed to the police that he intended to rape her.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The element of intent is a question for the jury, who may consider social conditions and customs founded upon racial differences in determining whether a defendant intended to commit a particular crime.

Facts
A white woman observed the Defendant, a black man, following her down a road. The woman told her children to run to a neighbor’s house so that the neighbor, a man, could come and meet her. At the approach of the neighbor, the Defendant backed off and went back down the street until he came to the front of the woman’s home. The woman watched Defendant from her neighbor’s porch for thirty minutes, until Defendant finally walked away. A sheriff testified at trial that Defendant had confessed to intending to rape the woman, though Defendant disputed ever making such a statement.

Issue
Was the Defendant’s action in following woman, together with the statement he made to authorities, sufficient to convict him of intent to commit rape?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
This case is notable insomuch as it seemed to permit social stereotypes about blacks to be used in drawing inferences about what Defendant’s intent was in following an unaccompanied white woman down the road.
