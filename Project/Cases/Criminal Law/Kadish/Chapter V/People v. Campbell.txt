22 Ill.124 Mich. App. 333, 335 N.W.2d 27 (Ct. App. 1983)

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Campbell (Defendant), encouraged the victim to commit suicide and offered him his own gun with which to do so. The victim, who had been drinking heavily with Defendant, fatally shot himself once Defendant had left.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Encouraging another person to kill himself and creating conditions to more readily facilitate that person in taking his life, does not rise to the level of intentional murder.

Facts
Defendant was angry with the victim for having had sex with Defendant’s wife. While at a bar with victim, where both men had been drinking heavily, he encouraged the victim to kill himself and offered victim his own gun. Having giving victim his gun, he then left the bar. Victim subsequently shot himself with the Defendant’s gun.

Issue
Does a person commit intentional murder if they merely encourage another person to commit suicide?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
This case is an example of the limits of homicide statutes. Encouraging another person to take his own life does not rise to murder. Provided the other person was the one who acted to take his own life, the death is still merely a suicide.
