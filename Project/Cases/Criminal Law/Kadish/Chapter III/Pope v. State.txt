Synopsis of Rule of Law
A person cannot be punished as a felon for failing to fulfill a moral obligation where no legal obligation exists.

Facts
Defendant took into her house a mother who suffered from mental illness and her three-month-old child. Two days after Defendant took them in, the mother went into a frenzy and beat the child, causing serious injury. Defendant witnessed the beating but failed to take steps to protect the child or to seek medical assistance. The child died during the night as a result of the beating and Defendant was charged and convicted of child abuse under the Annotated Code of Maryland as a principal in the first degree. Defendant was also found guilty of common law misprision of felony, a charge of intentional obstruction of justice where one has actual knowledge that a felony has been committed and actual knowledge of the identity of the felon. Defendant appeals.

Issue
Did the circuit court err in convicting Defendant by finding her to be the principal in the first degree in the commission of the crime of child abuse?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
This case illustrates the traditional reluctance of our criminal law to impose liability for omission to act even where the omission is clearly immoral.
