22 Ill.105 Cal. 66, 38 P. 518 (1894)

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant was convicted of larceny after he entered an acquaintance’s house and took a bicycle. Appellant claims he did not intend to keep the bicycle, and therefore, he is not guilty of larceny.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In order to be found guilty of larceny, an accused must have intended to permanently deprive the owner of his property.

Facts
Appellant Brown was a seventeen-year-old boy convicted of larceny. He entered an acquaintance’s house and took a bicycle. Brown stated he took the property to get even with a boy for throwing oranges at him. He also testified he did not intend to keep the bicycle, but rather intended to take it back on a Sunday. The trial court instructed the jury that with regard to larceny, the taking must be made with the intent to deprive the owner of the property. In addition, the court told the jury that the taker did not have to intend to deprive the owner permanently. An example was given in which a man takes a horse (not with the intent to convert it to his permanent use), rides it to a certain distance, and then leaves it. The issue on appeal is whether the court’s instructions were erroneous.

Issue
Were the judge’s instructions erroneous when he told the jury an individual can be found guilty of larceny if he intends to temporarily deprive the owner of his property?

Held
Yes. The order is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.

Discussion
The felonious intent of the party accused of larceny must be to permanently deprive the owner of his property, but there does not need to be an intention to convert the property to his own use.
