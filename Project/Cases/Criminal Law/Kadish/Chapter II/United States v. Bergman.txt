Even high character wrongdoers must be punished in order to set an example of general deterrence.

Facts

Bergman owned and managed a few nursing homes and the investigation exposed his fraudulent claims for Medicaid funds. It also exposed false filings of partnership returns and failing to list people who had purchased partnership interesting from him in his nursing homes. He was charged with conspiracy to mislead and defraud the Federal Government. The court charged him with four months of imprisonment as deterrence.

Issue
Whether four months imprisonment for a well educated, high character, high profile defendant is fitting for the crime of fraud he committed.

Held
Yes it is. Sentenced to a term of four months in prison.

Discussion
