Synopsis of Rule of Law
Words alone are not adequate provocation to reduce a second- degree murder charge to voluntary manslaughter.

Facts

Defendant appeals, arguing that his wife’s words during the argument were adequate provocation to reduce the charge to voluntary manslaughter.

Issue
Are words alone adequate provocation to reduce a second degree murder charge to voluntary manslaughter?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
