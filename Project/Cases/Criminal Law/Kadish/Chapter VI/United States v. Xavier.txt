Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Xavier (Defendant), procured a firearm for his brother, a convicted felon and as a result was convicted of aiding and abetting an ex-felon’s possession of a firearm, a crime under federal law. Because Defendant’s brother was an ex-convict, Defendant violated federal gun laws by procuring a firearm for him.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Unless a defendant has knowledge or cause to believe that the individual for whom he has procured a firearm is an ex-felon, he cannot be held criminally responsible under Section:922(d) for aiding and abetting an ex-felon in the possession of a firearm.

Facts
When the Defendant saw an enemy of his sitting in a parked car outside a grocery store, he drove off and then returned with a pistol, which he asked his companion to give to his brother. His brother, an ex-felon, then used the gun to shoot at their enemy sitting in the parked car. The Defendant was subsequently convicted for aiding and abetting his brother, a convicted felon, in the possession of a firearm, in violation of federal law. As an ex-convict, Defendant’s brother was prohibited from carrying a firearm. Thus, Defendant’s conduct in procuring a gun for another person, with the purpose that it be given to his brother, made Defendant an accomplice to his brother’s violation of federal law.

Issue
Is a defendant guilty of aiding and abetting an ex-felon in the possession of a firearm if he did not have knowledge or cause to believe that that individual had a prior conviction punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
This case demonstrates how, even though the Defendant may have committed a proscribed act, he cannot be criminally liable for the act without proof that he was aware of the principal’s status or attendant circumstances (in this case, his criminal background).
