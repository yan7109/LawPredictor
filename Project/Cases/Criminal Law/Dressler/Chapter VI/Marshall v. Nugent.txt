Citation
222 F.2d 604, 1955 U.S. App. 4810, 58 A.L.R.2d 251.

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant’s truck ran Plaintiff’s car off the road. Defendant stopped to help Plaintiff and told him to direct traffic. Another car stuck Plaintiff while attempting to avoid hitting Defendant’s truck.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Any extra risk created by a negligent tortfeasor is the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries if it is reasonably foreseeable.

Facts
Harriman, Marshall (Plaintiff’s) son-in-law, was driving when Prince (Defendant, Socony Oil Company) cut a corner and forced him off the road. No one was injured in the accident, and Defendant offered to help get the car back on the road. Plaintiff, a passenger in the car, went to direct traffic around the accident. Before Plaintiff could do so, Nugent (Defendant) swerved to avoid the truck and hit Plaintiff. Plaintiff sued both Defendants for damages from the accident. The jury returned a verdict for Nugent and for Plaintiff against Prince. Prince appealed, claiming that the accident was not the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injury.

Issue
Was Prince (Socony Oil Company), the proximate or legal cause of Plaintiff’s injuries?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Plaintiff’s injury was not too remote in time or place from the negligent conduct of Defendant. Defendant put Plaintiff in a dangerous situation. The jury could have rightfully decided if Defendant’s initial negligence was the legal cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.
