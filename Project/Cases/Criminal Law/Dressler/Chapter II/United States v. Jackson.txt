835 F.2d 1195, 1987 U.S. App. 16817.

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Dwight Jackson, was released from prison, to which he was sent for convictions on two bank robberies. Thirty minutes after release, he robbed another bank. The District Court sentenced him to life without parole.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The imposition of life imprisonment for a career criminal is permissible.

Facts
The Defendant had been serving a sentence of imprisonment for the robbery of two banks. Thirty minutes after his release from prison, he committed another bank robbery. He was back in jail before sundown on his day of release. The District Court sentenced the Defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole under a statue forbidding the possession of weapons by career criminals, and the Defendant appealed on the ground that the statute permitted a sentence of a determinate number of years but not a life sentence without the possibility of parole.

Issue
Did the Court properly sentence the Defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole?

Held
Yes. Affirmed.

Concurrence
The Defendant should not be imprisoned for life. A 20-year prison sentence will adequately serve the aim of deterrence, as a 55-year-old man is unlikely to commit robbery.

Discussion
The principles of deterrence and incapacitation permit imprisoning a repeat offender for life.
