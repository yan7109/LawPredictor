Brief Fact Summary
Defendant Mochan placed several telephone calls to Louise Zivkovich during which he made comments portraying the victim as lewd, immoral, and lascivious. While the conduct was not specifically proscribed by statute, the Defendant was charged and convicted under the common law.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Common law crimes continue to be punishable under the law.

Facts
Defendant Mochan was charged with intending “to debauch and corrupt, and further devising and intending to harass, embarrass and vilify” Louise Zivkovich. The Defendant was accused of calling the victim’s house and among other things, making indecent comments intending to injure the victim. No Pennsylvania statute specifically forbade the Defendant’s actions, but rather, he was convicted under the common law of outraging decency and injuring public morals. The Defendant thereafter appealed.

Issue
Was the Defendant properly convicted for violating the common law crime of outraging decency and injuring public morals?

Held
Yes. Conviction affirmed.

Dissent
By punishing under the common law, the judiciary is improperly invading a field that should be left to the legislature, namely deciding acts that injure the public.

Discussion
Nearly all states, including Pennsylvania, have abolished common law offenses.
