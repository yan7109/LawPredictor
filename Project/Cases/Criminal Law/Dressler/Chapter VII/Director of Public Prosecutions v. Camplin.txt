Brief Fact Summary
Defendant Camplin, a fifteen-year-old boy, killed the victim, Mohammed Lal Khan, after Khan allegedly sodomized the boy and taunted him.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The “reasonable person” standard requires that the jury account for the Defendant’s age and sex in considering provocation as a defense.

Facts
The Defendant killed the victim by splitting his skull with a frying pan. According to the Defendant, he and the victim were alone in Khan’s apartment. Khan sodomized him despite the Defendant’s resistance and laughed at him. The Defendant then fatally attacked the victim.

Issue
Did the trial court properly instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of provocation?

Held
No.

Concurrence
The individual characteristics of the Defendant should be considered in referencing the reasonable man standard. For instance, a hunchback is more sensitive to certain insults than other people. This must be considered.

Discussion
A “reasonable person” is an ordinary person of like sex and age.
