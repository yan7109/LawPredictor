Facts
The Defendant and the victim had been socially acquainted as a result of residing in the same apartment complex. The two had dated casually for a time until the victim broke it off. The Defendant claims that the end of the relationship devastated him. This rejection by the victim led to an obsession of her by the Defendant that caused him to act in ways that form the basis of his claim of extreme emotional distress. Namely, the Defendant would break into the apartment below the victim to eavesdrop on her relationships with other men. He also broke into the victim’s apartment and lay on her bed naked. Finally, the Defendant visited the victim’s apartment one last time offering gifts of wine and liquor. She rejected him again, and the Defendant produced a steak knife and stabbed her several times in the throat. The Defendant then dragged her to the bathroom and submerged her in a bathtub full of water to ensure her death.
