Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Mohammad Kargar (Defendant), an Afghani refugee, was convicted of two counts of gross sexual assault for kissing his young son’s penis. The Defendant sought to have the charges dismissed under a de minimis statute arguing that in his culture, kissing his son’s penis is an acceptable practice.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Since the defendant’s culture approved of the defendant’s conduct, he did not violate the sexual assault statute.

Discussion
Importantly, cultural acceptance is not a “defense.” Rather, the charges were dismissed as de minimis. In other words, the Defendant conduct, though technically in violation of the statute, was not so offensive to warrant conviction for the c
