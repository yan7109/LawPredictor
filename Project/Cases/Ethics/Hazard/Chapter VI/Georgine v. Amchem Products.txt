Facts
Plaintiffs, a group whose exact size is unknown but easily ranks in the “tens of thousands” represent a class of persons injured by asbestos products. In an attempt to reach a settlement with the Center for Claims Resolution (”CCR”), a conglomerate of asbestos companies, counsel from both parties spent a significant amount of time negotiating a complex settlement agreement. This agreement is now before the court for its final approval.

Issue

Held
Yes, the settlement was generally consistent with historical settlement averages, and is entirely fair to the class.

Discussion
