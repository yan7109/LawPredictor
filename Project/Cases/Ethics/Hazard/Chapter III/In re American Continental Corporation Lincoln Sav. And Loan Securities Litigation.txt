794 F. Supp. 1424,1992 U.S. Dist.Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) P97,005

Brief Fact Summary
In the aftermath of the early ’90s savings and loan scandal, law firm Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue was alleged to have condoned-and possibly even assisted in-an ongoing cover-up of serious regulatory violations committed by Lincoln.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The court considers a summary judgment motion brought by Jones Day to dismiss the claims brought against them.

Facts
In the course of its representation of these savings and loan corporations, Jones Day was alleged to have actively assisted its clients in attempting to cover up business practices that it knew to be fraudulent. In the course of an audit, Jones Day attorneys became aware of a variety of regulatory violations and deficiencies, but never challenged or reported them. Attorneys were actually instructed to “rectify” incriminating deficiencies and destroy any evidence of having done so. In its defense, Jones Day argued that its fiduciary duty prevented any other action, and that any attempt to advise the client otherwise would have been futile.

Issue
This case presented the following major issues:

Held
Jones Day’s motion for summary judgment was denied.

Discussion
Jones Day’s behavior in this case represents a particularly extreme example of what can happen when attorneys lose their ethical perspective in the course of the zealous representation of a client. Attorneys should avoid all appearance of impropriety whenever possible, and be sure to be advise the client as various possible violations arise. If a corporate client is unable or unwilling to change its behavior, the attorney’s highest duty is to the corporation itself, and fulfilling this duty may require the attorney to withdraw representation.
