22 Ill.867 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1989)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant and Plaintiff entered into a contract in which Plaintiff would provide a database service for Defendant’s travel agencies. The contracts contained liquidated damages clauses. Defendant canceled each contract before the expiration of the contract, breaching each one.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Liquidated damage provisions that do not serve as punitive damages against a breaching party are considered reasonable. Ambiguous portions that could be construed as either punitive or not punitive will be construed a not punitive.

Facts
Plaintiff operated a computer database that travel agents use to book airline tickets, rental cars, and hotel rooms. Plaintiff earns money by charging a subscription fee to the travel agents and by charging airlines other than Plaintiff that get customers, through this system a small fee.

Issue
Were the liquidated damages provisions in the contracts reasonable and enforceable?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The court upheld the punitive damages clauses in the contracts because it deemed the damages to be reasonable estimates of what Plaintiff’s damages would be in the event of a breach. The court construed the portion that was ambiguous to have a reasonable meaning.
