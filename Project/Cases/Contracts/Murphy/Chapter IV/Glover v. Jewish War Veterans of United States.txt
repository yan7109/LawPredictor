22 Ill.58, 68 A.2d 233 (D.C. 1949)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, Mary Glover, brought suit, regarding her entitlement to a reward that had been offered by Defendant, Jewish War Veterans of the United States, after she gave police information leading to the arrest and conviction of an individual who had murdered a Jewish Pharmacist.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
There is no contract and thus no acceptance of an offer of reward if an individual gives desired information, without the intention of accepting such an offer.

Facts
On June 5, 1946, Maurice Bernstein, a pharmacist, was murdered. The Defendant, the Jewish War Veterans of the United States (Defendant), offered a $500 reward to anyone offering information that lead to the arrest and conviction of the person(s) guilty of murdering Bernstein. The Plaintiff, Mary Glover (Plaintiff), pointed the police to Reginald Wheeler (Wheeler), the boyfriend of her daughter, who was later convicted of the crime.

Issue
This case presents the issue as to whether an offeree can accept an offer, if he or she does not know of its existence.

Held
Affirmed.

Discussion
Mutual assent must be had by both the offeror and the offeree. An offeree cannot assent to an agreement after he or she has already performed, thereby binding an offeror who may not intend to be bound.
