22 Ill.870 F.2d 423 (7th Cir. 1989)

Brief Fact Summary
Both parties exchanged letters of intent, regarding the sale of Defendant’s assets to Plaintiff, both also acknowledging that security for Plaintiff’s note would need to be agreed upon. The parties failed to agree upon security and suit followed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case stands for the proposition that mutual letters of intent do not bind the parties to an agreement when integral terms are undecided.

Facts
The Defendant, Ball-Co Manufacturing, Inc. (Defendant), floated its assets on the open-market, to determine if there was interest in purchasing the company. The Plaintiff, Empro Manufacturing Co., Inc. (Plaintiff), expressed interest and formulated a letter of intent, to which Defendant responded in kind with another letter of intent, also noting that security for Plaintiff’s note would need to be agreed upon, prior to sale. After the parties could not reach an agreement as to how security would be provided for Plaintiff’s note, Defendant began to look at other prospective buyers. When Plaintiff became aware of this fact, it filed suit for performance, based on mutual intent, or alternatively, for reliance expenditures it made in anticipation of the agreement. Defendant’s suit was dismissed and it appealed.

Issue
This case explores the question of whether mutual letters of intent are meant to be a binding agreement, in lieu of the fact that all terms of the deal are still undecided.

Held
Affirmed.

Discussion
When parties intend to deal with one another at a future date, it is important to look at their intent and the terms by which they have agreed. If the parties have agreed to all terms that could or could not be enforceable, then it is reasonable to hold them to those terms. If, however, the parties leave terms out, anticipating future negotiations, it is obvious that a binding agreement has not yet been reached.
