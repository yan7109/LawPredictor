Brief Fact Summary
Defendant, an attorney, was directed by a client to include a bequest of money to Plaintiff in client’s will. Defendant failed to do so and client died.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A person who was intended to benefit from a client’s bequest may sue client’s lawyer if the lawyer fails to include the bequest in client’s will and client dies.

Facts
Client directed Defendant to write a bequest of money for Plaintiff into client’s will. When Client died, no such bequest was found in the will or in any accompanying document. Plaintiff tried to get judicial reformation of the will. Failing, Plaintiff brought this suit against Defendant.

Issue
May Plaintiff sue Defendant for leaving a bequest, intended for Plaintiff out of client’s will?

Held
Yes

Discussion
An intended beneficiary has the right to enforce the contract just as one who made the contract. If performance is not possible, the intended beneficiary may sue for damages, just as one who made the contract could.
