22 Ill. 72 N.J. Eq. 831, 2 Buch. 831, 66 A. 935 (Ch. 1907)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant breached his contract to sell all the tomatoes produced from certain tracks of land, to Plaintiff. Plaintiff sued for specific performance

Synopsis of Rule of Law
When there are circumstances when money damages would not compensate the injured party in a breach of contract action, the court may order specific performance even if the goods or services involved were not unique.

Facts
Plaintiff has a tomato-canning factory. Defendant made a contract with Plaintiff to sell Plaintiff tomatoes. Plaintiff’s factory has a six-week season to pack tomatoes, and it uses the time before that season to prepare for the packing season by hiring personnel and purchasing supplies based on the number of tomatoes they anticipate packing. Defendant breached the contract to sell the tomatoes to Plaintiff. Plaintiff sued Defendant, asking the court to order specific performance.

Issue
Should the court grant the Plaintiff specific performance?

Held
Yes.

Discussion
The court rejected the notion that specific performance was only for cases involving the sale of land, and expands it to cover any situation when money damages will not compensate the injured party.
