Brief Fact Summary
Organ entered into a contract to purchase tobacco from Laidlaw at an agreed upon price. Prior to completion of the sale, Plaintiff learned of the end of the War of 1812, but did not disclose that information to Defendant, when asked if Plaintiff knew any information that would affect the terms of their agreement, at the close of the sale. Plaintiff brought suit to recover the tobacco, at the agreed-upon price, and Defendant countered that Plaintiff dealt in bad faith.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
This case is among the beginning of a line of cases that explores the duties of good faith and disclosure in contractual negotiations.

Facts
The Plaintiff/vendee, Organ (Plaintiff) and the Defendant, Laidlaw/vendor (Defendant), entered into an agreement whereby Plaintiff would buy tobacco from Defendant at an agreed upon price. Prior to completion of the sale, Plaintiff learned the War of 1812 was ending and that the value of the product would substantially increase. Defendant, at close of the sale, asked Plaintiff if he knew of any information that would affect the value of the product and Plaintiff answered in the negative, and took possession of the tobacco. The next morning, Defendant recovered the tobacco, upon learning of the change in circumstances, and Plaintiff brought suit to enforce the contract.

Issue
This case explores whether fraud necessarily voids a contract and whether it must be proven by positive communication or whether suppression of information could also amount to fraud.

Held
Venire de novo awarded. (Remanded for a new trial.)

Discussion
This case begins to consider the duty of disclosure. When a promisee asks a direct question of a promisor, it could amount to bad faith if the promisor withholds information that could change the promisee’s position.
