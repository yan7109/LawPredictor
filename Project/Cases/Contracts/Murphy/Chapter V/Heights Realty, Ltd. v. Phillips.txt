Facts
The Plaintiff, Heights Realty, Ltd. (Plaintiff), entered into an exclusive listing contract with the Defendant, Philips (Defendant), the Conservator of the estate of Johnye Mary Gholson (”Mrs. Gholson”), who was 84 years old when she signed the contract. Later, it became evident that the Defendant was mentally incapable to handle her affairs. Plaintiff brought suit to enforce its commission. At a bench trail of this matter, the Court found that Mrs. Gholson lacked the mental capacity to have entered into the contract. Plaintiff appealed, on the grounds that the conservator of Mrs. Gholson’s estate, the Defendant, could not overcome a presumption of competency.

Issue
The issue presented by this case is whether an 84 year old woman, who was later adjudicated incompetent, had the capacity to contract.

Held
Affirmed.

Discussion
When someone is mentally incapable of entering into a contract, any agreement made with that person is null. Mental capacity can be determined by a variety of factors, including personal and expert witnesses, along with information about the person’s mental state before and after the period of incompetency.
