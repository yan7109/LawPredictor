Citation
22 Ill.73 Md. App. 16, 532 A.2d 1089 (Ct. Spec. App. 1988)

Brief Fact Summary
Appellant Winternitz was a tenant of Appellee Summit Hills Joint Venture. Appellant entered into an agreement to sell his business under the belief that he could transfer his lease to the buyer. Appellee revoked permission to transfer the lease.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Part performance applies when specific performance is sought, but not when the party is seeking damages.

Facts
Appellant operated a pharmacy. On January 31, 1983, Appellant’s six year lease expired. The lease provided that if Appellant remained in possession, Appellant would become a month-to-month tenant and the rent would continue to be $1,658. Either Appellant or Appellee could terminate the month-to-month tenancy with 30 days written notice.

Issue
Did the lower court err by nullifying the jury verdicts?

Held
The court erred in nullifying the jury verdict on the malicious interference with contractual relationship claim, but did not err in nullifying the jury verdict on the breach of contract claim.

Discussion
In the present case, the Court did not allow Appellant to use part performance to bring his breach of contract claim because he was seeking damages and not specific performance. However, the Court held that the lower court erred in nullifying the jury verdict on the malicious interference with contractual relationship claim because the claim could be brought even though the contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds and Appellant had presented sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding.
