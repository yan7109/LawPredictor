22 Ill.33 F. Supp. 2d 66 (D. Mass. 1998)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, wife of the late Martin Luther King, Jr., initiated this action to recover some of King’s papers from Defendant Boston University. King provided the papers and other items to Defendant along with a letter indicating that upon his death they would become the property of Defendant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Where there is donative intent and evidence that could support a finding of a promise supported by consideration or reliance, the case is properly submitted to the jury.

Facts
Defendant asked King if he would deposit some of his papers in its library’s newly expanded special collections. Several other universities approached King around the same time. Plaintiff testified that King thought the papers would be safest at Defendant’s library, but thought placing them there could subject him to criticism.

Issue
Was the case properly submitted to the jury?

Held
Yes. The case was properly submitted to the jury.

Discussion
In the present case, the Court determined that there was evidence that could support a finding of clear donative intent supported by consideration or reliance. Because there was sufficient evidence for such a finding, the case was properly submitted to the jury.
