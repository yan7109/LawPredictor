22 Ill.226 S.W.2d 673 (Tex. Civ. App. 1949)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, Batsakis, loaned Defendant, Demotsis, 500,000 drachmae. In exchange for the loan, Defendant signed an instrument promising to pay Plaintiff $2,000 in U.S. currency. The 500,000 drachmae were worth approximately $25.00 at the time.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Inadequacy of consideration alone will not void a contract.

Facts
Due to conditions created by World War II, Defendant could not access money and property owned in the United States. Knowing that Defendant was in financial distress, Plaintiff agreed to lend Defendant 500,000 drachmae, worth at the time approximately $25.00 in U.S. currency. In exchange of the money loaned by Plaintiff, Defendant executed a written instrument promising to pay Plaintiff $2,000 in U.S. currency.

Issue
Was the consideration inadequate?

Held
No. The consideration was not inadequate.

Discussion
In this case, the Court expressed a reluctance to weigh the adequacy of consideration. Without evidence of fraud, duress, or misrepresentation, the Court is unwilling to void the contract merely because there may be insufficient consideration.
