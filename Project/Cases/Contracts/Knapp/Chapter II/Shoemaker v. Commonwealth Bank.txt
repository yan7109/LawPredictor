Synopsis of Rule of Law
Summary judgment is inappropriate for a promissory estoppel claim where a genuine issue as to each element is present.

Facts
Plaintiffs obtained a mortgage on their home from Defendant. Pursuant to the mortgage agreement, Plaintiffs were required to carry insurance on the property. Plaintiffs allege that they received a letter from Defendant informing them that their homeowner’s insurance had been cancelled and, if a new policy was not purchased, Defendant would purchase a policy and add the premium to the balance of their loan. Plaintiffs also allege that they received a phone call from Defendant to the same effect. Due to the letter and telephone call, Plaintiffs claim they did not realize the house was not insured until after it was destroyed by fire.

Issue

Held

Discussion
