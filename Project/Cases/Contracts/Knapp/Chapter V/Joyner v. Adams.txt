262 Fed.Appx. 498,2008 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff Joyner leased property to Defendant Adams. The lease provided for suspension of a rent increase for a specified time if there was complete development of the subdivision during that time.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The maxim for construing an agreement against the drafter applies to contract construction, but not contract interpretation.

Facts
Plaintiff leased property to Brown. The property was to be subdivided and the rent would increase over the term of the lease. In 1975, Brown had some financial difficulties so Defendant was substituted. The rent increase was suspended for a time to allow Defendant to subdivide the property. Defendant was to complete the subdivision during the suspension of the rate increase. If the subdivision was not completed, Defendant would be liable for the rent increases that would have occurred during the suspension. At the end of the suspension, all of the lots but one had buildings and separate lot leases. The remaining lot had been graded, had water and sewer lines, and all driveways and roads leading to the lot were built. The parties disagree as to whether Defendant met the subdivision requirement of completed development for suspending the lease.

Issue
Should the contract be construed against Plaintiff as the drafter?

Held
No. The contract should not be construed against Plaintiff as the drafter.

Discussion
In the present case, the Court held that the maxim construing a contract provision against the drafter was not properly applied for two reasons. First, the maxim applies to contract construction, not contract interpretation. Second, it is unclear whether Plaintiff actually drafted the provision.
