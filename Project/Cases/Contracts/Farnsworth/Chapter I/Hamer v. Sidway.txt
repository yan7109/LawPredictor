Brief Fact Summary
P sued D for beach of contract and D contended that the promise was not supported by consideration.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In general, a waiver of any legal right at the request of another party is sufficient consideration for a promise.

Facts
Story (D) agreed with his nephew William (P) that if P would refrain from drinking, using tobacco, swearing, and playing cards or billiards for money until he became 21, D would pay him $5,000. When P became 21 he wrote a letter to D stating that P had performed his part of the agreement and had earned the $5,000. P and D agreed that $5,000 plus interest should remain with D until P was capable of taking care of it. D died without paying P the $5,000 plus interest. Judgment for D. P appealed.

Issue
Is mere abstention from legal conduct sufficient consideration?

Held
Yes. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
Under the bargain test for consideration, P’s forbearance was arguably both a benefit to D and a detriment to P. D benefited by having his nephew refrain from certain conduct and P suffered a detriment by denying himself the enjoyment of that conduct.
