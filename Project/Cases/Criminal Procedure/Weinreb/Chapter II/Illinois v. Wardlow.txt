Brief Fact Summary
An individual was arrested after fleeing from police officers in a known narcotics trafficking area.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The arresting officer “was justified in suspecting that [the suspect] was involved in criminal activity, and, therefore in investigating further.”

Facts
The Respondent, Wardlow (the “Respondent”), fled from an area known for heavy narcotics trafficking after seeing police officers.  The Respondent was caught by two officers and they conducted a protective pat down for weapons.  The officers found a 38-caliber handgun and arrested the Respondent.

Issue
Did the stop by the police officers violate the Constitution?

Held
No.  The majority first observed that the brief encounter in this case was governed by the analysis in [Terry], which concerned “reasonable suspicion” of criminal activity being “afoot.”  Someone solely being in an area of high crime is not enough standing alone to support a reasonable particularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime.  However, “officers are not required to ignore the relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation.”  It is one of the “relevant contextual considerations in a [Terry] analysis.”

Discussion
This case should be compared and contrasted with [Terry].
