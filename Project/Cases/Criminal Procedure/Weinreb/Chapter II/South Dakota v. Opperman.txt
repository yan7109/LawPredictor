Synopsis of Rule of Law
The police are allowed to inventory an impounded car if the procedure is designed to protect the vehicle and its contents.

Facts
Local police impounded the Respondent’s vehicle for a traffic violation. Without a warrant, the police opened Respondent’s unlocked vehicle to inventory its contents. Taking an inventory of impounded vehicle was part of local police procedure. While taking this inventory, police found marijuana in the glove box of Respondent’s vehicle. Respondent was subsequently tried and convicted for possession of marijuana.

Issue
Without a warrant, are police allowed to inventory a vehicle that is lawfully impounded for a traffic violation?

Held
Yes. Impounded vehicles can be inventoried where the process is carried out to secure the vehicle and its contents.

Dissent
The Fourth Amendment applies to vehicles, and a routine inventory search is not an exigent circumstance warranting an exception to the Fourth Amendment.

Discussion
Administrative procedures, such as inventorying an impounded vehicle, are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment if the procedure is implemented for a non-criminal purpose.
