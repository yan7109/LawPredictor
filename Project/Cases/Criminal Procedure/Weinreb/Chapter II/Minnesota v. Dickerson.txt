508 U.S. 366, 113 S. Ct. 2130, 124 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1993)

Brief Fact Summary
A police officer patted down a suspect and discovered a small amount of crack cocaine in his jacket.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
“If a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect’s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect’s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer’s search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure  would be justified by the same practical considerations that inhere in the plain-view context.”

Issue
“[W]hether the Fourth Amendment permits the seizure of contraband detected through a police officer’s sense of touch during a protective patdown search[?]”

Held
The majority first discussed the parameters of [Terry] and observed “[i]f the protective search goes beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed, it is no longer valid under [Terry] and its fruits will be suppressed.”

Discussion
This case should be read alongside [Terry] to see the court’s progression of this line of cases.
