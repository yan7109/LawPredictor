509 U.S. 688, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556, 1993 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
This case arises from the consolidation of two cases which both deal with the Double Jeopardy clause.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Double Jeopardy arises when a defendant is prosecuted twice on the same offense, or is subsequently prosecuted for a lesser-included offense which could have been prosecuted the first time.

Facts
There are two distinguishable fact situations which the Court is dealing with:

Issue
This case questions whether a criminal can be later charged in contempt for committing the same crime of which he is already being prosecuted.

Held
Dixon’s secondary indictment was dismissed because it was found that it was double jeopardy; however, Foster was still indicted on three of four counts because double jeopardy did not apply to subsequent greater offenses.

Dissent
According to Justice Rehnquist, double jeopardy should not apply to contempt charges because it is a separate and distinguishable offense, and the elements of contempt are entirely different from the elements of the substantive crimes from which the contempt charges arose.

Discussion
While, at first, Double Jeopardy may seem confusing, it is simply the rule that a defendant cannot be prosecuted more than once for the same crime or for a crime arising out of the same course of action.
