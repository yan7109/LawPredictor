69 N.H. 257, 44 A. 809, 1897 N.H.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, who was eight-years-old, trespassed in Defendant’s mill. Plaintiff’s hand was crushed in a machine.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An owner of land owes a trespasser a duty to abstain from any other or further intentional or negligent acts of personal violence. Owners are not bound to warn trespassers of hidden or secret dangers.

Facts
Plaintiff trespassed in Defendant’s mill when weaving machinery was in operation. An overseer told him to leave. The running machinery presented an obvious hazard to a child of Plaintiff’s age. Plaintiff’s hand was crushed in a machine that his brother, aged 13, an employee, was trying to teach him to run. The trial court denied a motion for a directed verdict. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Assuming that Plaintiff was incapable either of appreciating the danger or of exercising the care necessary to avoid it, is he entitled to recover?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
In this case, Plaintiff is characterized as a trespasser and as such, Defendant breached no duty of care owed to him.
