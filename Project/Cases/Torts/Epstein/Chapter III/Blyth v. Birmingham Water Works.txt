156 Eng. Rep. 1047 (Ex.1856).

Brief Fact Summary
Blyth’s (Plaintiff’s) house was flooded with water, because of a plug that was frozen over during one of the most severe storms in recent history.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In a claim of negligence, the issue of duty is a question of law, not properly left for the determination of a jury. It would be monstrous to hold Defendant’s responsible because they did not foresee and prevent an obscure accident that was not discovered until many months thereafter.

Facts
Defendant was hired by the city to lay pipe for a water main. The pipes were built out of materials, which were sound and in good order. One of the most severe storms created frost on the stopper, which caused the water to force its way around the neck of the main, and on the ground into Plaintiff’s house. The judge left it to the jury to consider whether Defendant had used proper care to prevent the accident to Plaintiff’s house. The jury found a verdict for Plaintiff. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Is Defendant negligent for failing to guard Plaintiff’s house against one of the most severe storms?

Held
No. Judgment for Defendant.

Discussion
In this case, Defendant owed no duty to Plaintiff. The issue of duty is one of law, not of fact. Juries decide issues of fact. Judges decide issues of law. Because Defendant owed Plaintiff no duty to inspect the pipes and remove the ice and snow, which had accumulated, it was not proper for the trial court to submit Plaintiff’s claim of negligence to the jury.
