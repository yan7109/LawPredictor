Synopsis of Rule of Law
When a statute or municipal ordinance imposes upon any person a specific duty for the protection or benefit of others, if he neglects to perform that duty he is liable to those for which the statute was designed to protect or benefit.

Facts
Defendant’s clerk in his drugstore sold to Plaintiff a deadly poison without labeling it as “Poison” as required be statute. Not knowing it was poison, Plaintiff consumed it and died. Plaintiff sued Defendant for negligence. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Is Defendant negligent for the breach of duty imposed by statute?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Negligence can be a breach of a duty imposed by common law or a breach of a duty imposed by a statute. A breach of a duty imposed by statute is called negligence per se, it is conclusive evidence of negligence. However, to recover under negligence per se, the legislature must have intended to protect Plaintiff from an injury that they had contemplated when passing the statute, and Plaintiff must be in the group of people that the legislature intended to protect.
