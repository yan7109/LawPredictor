54 Wn.2d 174, 338 P.2d 743, 1959 Wash.

Brief Fact Summary
Fletcher (Plaintiff), a blind man, fell into a ditch excavated by the City of Aberdeen (Defendant). Defendant failed to provide proper barricades up at the time Plaintiff fell. Plaintiff sued Defendant for negligence.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The duty of maintaining the sidewalks and adjacent parking strips is a continuing one. A city is obligated to afford that degree of protection, which would bring notice to a person with a physical disability, the danger being encountered.

Facts
For the purpose of placing electric wires underground, the city (Defendant) dug a ditch in the parking strip adjacent to the sidewalk. Defendant erected suitable barricades to protect pedestrians from falling into the ditch. One of Defendant’s employees removed the barricades while working on another site and negligently failed to replace them. Plaintiff, a blind man, fell into the ditch while the barricades were down. By use of his cane, the barriers would have prevented Plaintiff from falling into the ditch. Plaintiff sued Defendant for negligence. The jury returned a verdict for Plaintiff and found that the city was negligent in removing the barriers without providing other warning.

Issue
Must the city exercise a standard of care above that of an ordinary person for a disabled person?

Held
Yes. Judgment for Plaintiff affirmed.

Discussion
In this case the court held that Defendant, a city, is obligated at all times to warn pedestrians of dangers encountered on the sidewalk, whether that pedestrian be physically disabled or in perfect health.
