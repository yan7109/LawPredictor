Brief Fact Summary
Andrews (Plaintiff) an airline passenger, was hit in the head after a briefcase fell out of United Airlines’ (Defendant) overhead compartment. The district court granted summary judgment for Defendant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Common carriers owe both a duty of utmost care and the vigilance of a very cautious person towards its passengers. The jury is equipped to decide whether an airline has a duty to do more than warn passengers about the possibility of falling luggage.

Facts
During a mad scramble, a briefcase fell from an overhead compartment of Defendant and seriously injured Plaintiff. It is not clear who opened the overhead compartment. Plaintiff does not claim that Defendant’s personnel were involved Rather, Plaintiff claims that her injury was foreseeable and that Defendant did not prevent it. The district court dismissed the suit on summary judgment. Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
Is it proper for the jury to hear Plaintiff’s claim of negligence against Defendant, that the injury was foreseeable and Defendant was negligent in not preventing it?

Held
Yes. Summary judgment is not proper in this case. Reversed and remanded.

Discussion
A common carrier has a heightened duty of care due to the fact that passengers are completely dependent upon them for safety precautions.
