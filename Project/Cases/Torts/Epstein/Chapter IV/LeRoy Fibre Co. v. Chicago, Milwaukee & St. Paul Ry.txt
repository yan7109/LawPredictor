Brief Fact Summary
Sparks from Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry’s (Defendant’s) train ignited Plaintiff’s stack of straw. The jury found that Defendant negligently operated its train by allowing it to emit large quantities of sparks and live cinders. However, the jury found Plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence by placing the exposed stacks within 100 feet of a railroad track.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The rights of one man in the use of his property cannot be limited by the wrongs of another.

Facts
Plaintiff stored about 700 tons of straw in 230 stacks on his land. The stacks were lined up in two rows. Defendant’s train was 70 from the first row and 85 feet from the second row. One day a high wind carried sparks from Defendant’s train to the stack located 85 feet away. A fire resulted and consumed all the stacks. Plaintiff sued Defendant for negligence. The jury found that Defendant negligently operated its train by allowing it to emit large quantities of sparks and live cinders. They also found that Defendant’s negligence was the cause of Plaintiff’s harm. However, the jury found Plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence by placing the exposed stacks within 100 feet of a railroad track. Plaintiff appealed. Plaintiff argued that there was no issue of contributory negligence to give to the jury at all.

Issue
Does Plaintiff’s act of placing stacks of straw on his land close to Defendant’s railroad constitute contributory negligence?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Discussion
Plaintiff does not have to guard against another’s wrongful use of their land. Plaintiff need only make sure that he is using his land properly. The affirmative defense of contributory negligence is not applicable against a party making a lawful and reasonable use of their land.
