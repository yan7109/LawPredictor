Brief Fact Summary
Mohr (Plaintiff) brought suit against Williams (Defendant), a surgeon, for assault and battery after Defendant successfully and skillfully performed an operation on Plaintiff’s left ear that impaired Plaintiff’s hearing.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
If an operation is performed without Plaintiff’s consent, and the circumstances were not such as to justify its performance without consent, then the operation is wrongful and thus unlawful.

Facts
Plaintiff brought suit against Defendant for assault and battery. Defendant, an excellent physician and ear specialist, examined Plaintiff’s right and left ear. Defendant informed Plaintiff of the result of his examination and advised her to have an operation on her right ear. Plaintiff was not informed that her left ear was in any way diseased. Plaintiff agreed to undergo surgery on her right ear.

Issue
Did Plaintiff impliedly consent to an operation on her left ear when she consented to an operation on her right ear?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
Plaintiff’s consent to an operation on one ear does not extend to an operation on the other ear. In genuine emergencies, an implied consent may be found.
