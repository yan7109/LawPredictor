Brief Fact Summary
Mcquire (Plaintiff), a registered nurse, was hired to care for Almy (Defendant), an insane person. During a violent attack, Defendant stuck Plaintiff with the leg of a low-boy (a piece of furniture). Plaintiff brought suit against Defendant for assault and battery.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
An insane person is liable for his intentional torts.

Facts
Plaintiff was a registered nurse. Defendant was an insane person. Before Plaintiff was hired to care for Defendant, she learned that Defendant had a mental disorder, but was in good physical health. During the period of fourteen months, while Plaintiff cared for Defendant, Defendant had a few odd spells when she showed hostility towards Plaintiff. Defendant, while locked in her room, had a violent attack during which she broke furniture and warned Plaintiff not to enter Defendant’s room or she would be killed. Plaintiff decided that it would be better to remove the broken items before Defendant did any more harm to herself. Plaintiff approached Defendant, who was positioned with the leg of a low-boy raised above her head, ready to strike. Plaintiff tried to grab Defendant’s hand and Defendant struck Plaintiff, causing injuries for which the action was brought. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiff. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Is Defendant, an insane person, liable for assault and battery?

Held
Yes. Judgment for Plaintiff on the verdict.

Discussion
An insane person will be liable for his or her torts. Previous rulings involving insanity have prevented liability for certain intentional torts such as defamation and deceit largely because they require a malicious intent. In those cases, the law holds that such intent must be shown.
