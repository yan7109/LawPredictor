108 Fed. Appx. 548, 2004 U.S. App.

Brief Fact Summary
Stone (Plaintiff) was struck in the head by cricket ball from Defendant’s cricket club. Plaintiff sued Defendant for public nuisance and negligence.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Plaintiff’s injury was caused by a reasonably foreseeable risk and Defendant is liable for damages since he had a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent it.

Facts
Plaintiff lived on a side street next to a cricket ground. She was at the gate in front of the house when she was struck on the head by a cricket ball. The ball that hit Plaintiff was one of the longest balls that had ever been hit at the grounds during the last forty years. The cricket ground was large enough for all practical purposes. The field was surrounded by twelve-foot high fence. Witnesses testified that over a thirty-year period about six to ten balls had been hit onto Plaintiff’s side street. Plaintiff sued the home cricket club and all of its members (Defendants). She alleged that the grounds constituted a public nuisance. She separately alleged common law negligence. The trial court gave judgment to the Defendants on both the public nuisance and negligence counts. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on the negligence claim. Defendant then appealed to the House of Lords.

Issue
If a risk is reasonably foreseeable, is there a duty to prevent it?

Held
Yes. Judgment for Defendant.

Discussion
In this case, the court did not want to force Plaintiff to bare the burden of an unlikely but foreseeable risk of injury. The court held Defendant liable on the basis of forseeability.
