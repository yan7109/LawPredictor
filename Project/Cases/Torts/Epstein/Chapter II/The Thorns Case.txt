If one does harm to the person or property of another, he is liable for the damage he causes even if it is an unintentional, lawful act that has caused the damage.

Facts

Issue
Is Defendant liable for trespass for the lawful cutting and unintentional dropping of the thorns onto Plaintiff’s land?

Held
Yes. Judgment for the Plaintiff. The Thorns Case is an old English case. There is a debate among five lawyers followed by the opinions of two judges.

Dissent
Two lawyers write dissenting opinions. They believe Defendant should not be liable to Plaintiff for trespass.

Discussion
One who voluntarily does an act that results in damage to another’s property is responsible for the damage even if the act was lawful. Since Defendant’s actions caused Plaintiff’s damages, he is liable in tort. The majority opinion adopts a rule of strict liability.
