24 Nev. 251, 52 P. 274, 1898 Nev.

Brief Fact Summary
Water from Defendant’s reservoir escaped onto Plaintiff’s land because of an unknown latent defect in Defendant’s subsoil. Plaintiff sued Defendant for trespass.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
One who lawfully brings something onto his land, which though harmless while it remains there will naturally do mischief if it escapes the land, will be strictly liable for its escape.

Facts
Plaintiff was damaged by his property being flooded by water, which, without any fault on his part, broke out of a reservoir constructed on Defendants’ land. Water in the reservoir would not have escaped from Defendant’s land and no mischief would have been done to Plaintiff, but for a latent defect in Defendant’s subsoil. Plaintiff sued Defendant for trespass. Opinions are taken from the intermediate appellate court.

Issue
Is Defendant liable to Plaintiff in trespass for damage caused as a result of a defect in Defendant’s land if they were not aware of the defect?

Held
(L.C. Cairns) Yes. Judgment for Plaintiff.

Discussion
In this case the court adopts a theory of strict liability for owners who bring unnatural things upon their land, which later escapes.
