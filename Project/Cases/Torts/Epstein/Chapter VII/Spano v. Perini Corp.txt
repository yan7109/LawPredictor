Brief Fact Summary
Spano’s (Plaintiff’s) garage was destroyed by Perini Corp.’s (Defendant’s) non-negligent explosion of 194 sticks of dynamite on its nearby property. The trial court awarded Plaintiff damages.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
One who engages in blasting must assume responsibility and be liable without fault for any injury he causes to neighboring property.

Facts
Spano’s (Plaintiff’s) garage and Davis’ (Plaintiff’s) car, which was in the garage, were both wrecked by shock waves from a dynamite blast set off by Defendant on its nearby property. Defendant set off 194 sticks of dynamite about 125 feet from Plaintiff’s garage. There was no physical trespass and no proof of negligence on the part of Defendant. Prior law under Booth v. Rome required that negligence must be shown, unless the blast was accompanied by a physical invasion of the property. No attempt at trial was made to show that Defendant had failed to use reasonable care. The court awarded Spano, $4,400.00, and Davis, $329.00. Defendant appealed.

Issue
May a person that has sustained property damage caused by blasting on nearby property, maintain an action for damages without a showing that the blaster was negligent?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
When dealing with explosives, a Defendant is strictly liable for the resulting damage done to a neighbor’s land. Abnormally dangerous materials are always subject to strict liability, but make sure that it was the abnormally dangerous activity that caused the injury.
