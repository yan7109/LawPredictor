During the winter months, from two in the afternoon until the end of the day, the shadow of Defendant’s addition will extend over the cabana, swimming pool, and sunbathing areas of Eden Roc, which is located on the southern portion of Plaintiff’s property. Plaintiff filed suit when the addition was eight stories high.
