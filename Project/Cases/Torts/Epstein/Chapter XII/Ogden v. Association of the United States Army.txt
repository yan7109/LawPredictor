177 F. Supp. 498, 1959 U.S. Dist.

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff brought suit for an allegedly libelous book that was originally published at a time that would have caused the statute of limitation to have accrued, but more copies had been published since then.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under the single publication rule, written material containing defamatory matter gives rise to only one cause of action for libel. This cause accrues at the time of the original publication, and the statute of limitation runs from that date.

Facts
A book containing allegedly libelous material was published in November, 1955. This suit was filed on June 25, 1959. The District of Columbia has a 1-year statute of limitations for defamation.

Issue
Does the District of Colombia apply the single publication rule?

Held
