Synopsis of Rule of Law
The First Amendment of the United States Constitution (Constitution) requires proof of actual malice for libel actions brought by public officials against critics of their official conduct.

Facts
The Respondent was one of three elected Commissioners of Montgomery, Alabama. His duties included supervision of the police department. The Respondent brought suit against the Petitioner, alleging that he was libeled by statements made in a full-page advertisement carried by the Petitioner.

The Plaintiff was not mentioned by name, but claimed that the statements attributed misconduct to him as supervisor of the Montgomery Police Department. A jury at Circuit Court awarded respondent damages of $500,000 and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed.
