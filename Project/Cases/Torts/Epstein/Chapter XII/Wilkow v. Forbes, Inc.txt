Brief Fact Summary
In an article, Forbes Magazine (Defendant) stated that Marc Wilkow (Plaintiff) paid only $55 million on a $93 million loan. Plaintiff sued Defendant for defamation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Language that states an opinion without stating an outright lie is not the defamatory language required to maintain a cause of action for defamation.

Facts
Defendant runs a column on pending litigation of interest to the business community. In one issue, Defendant ran an article that covered the case of Bank of America National Trust & Savings Ass’n v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership. According to Defendant’s article, a partnership led by Plaintiff “stiffed” the bank paying only $55 million on a $93 million loan while retaining ownership of the building. Plaintiff sued Defendant claiming that the article defamed him by asserting that he was in poverty and had filched the bank’s money. The district court returned a verdict for Defendant. Plaintiff appealed.

Issue
Does Defendant’s article use false or defamatory statements?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
In order to maintain a cause of action for defamation, the language must be false or defamatory. In this case, there was no statement that was false and it was not defamatory. The court makes mention that the article could have in fact helped Plaintiff.
