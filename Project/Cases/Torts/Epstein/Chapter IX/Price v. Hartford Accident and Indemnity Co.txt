Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Charles Price (Plaintiff), was sued for punitive damages resulting from an accident caused by a drag race. The Defendant, Plaintiff’s insurance company, Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. (Defendant), claimed that it was not responsible for the punitive damage claim based on public policy considerations.

Synopsis of Rule of Law

Facts
Gary Gardner was injured as a result of a drag race between the Plaintiff and another individual. Gardner brought suit against Plaintiff for $100,000 in compensatory and $25,000 in punitive damages.

Plaintiff’s policy with Defendant had a $1,000,000 limit and promised to pay for all sums he might become liable to pay. Plaintiff and his mother sought a declaratory judgment that the policy included punitive damages coverage. The trial court found against the Plaintiff, and Plaintiff appeals.
