Facts

Issue
Can the strict products liability applied to a retailer also be imposed on a defendant who is outside the original producing and marketing chain?

Held
No. Judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed.

Dissent
Justice Goldenhers stated that the application of strict liability is intended to place the burden of losses on those who have created the risk and reaped profit by placing the product into the stream of commerce. There is no justification for not applying the same standard to used car dealers.

Discussion
The majority of courts have declined to place the burdens of strict liability on the sellers of used products.
