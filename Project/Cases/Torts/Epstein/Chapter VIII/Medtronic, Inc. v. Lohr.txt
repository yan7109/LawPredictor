518 U.S. 470, 116 S. Ct. 2240,135 L. Ed. 2d 700, 1996 U.S.

Brief Fact Summary
The Plaintiff, Lora Lohr (Plaintiff), required emergency surgery when a pacemaker manufactured by the Defendant, Medtronic, Inc. (Defendant), failed. Plaintiff sued under state laws alleging negligence and strict liability. Defendant answered by moving the case to federal court and claiming preemption of state law by a federal act.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A federal law enacted by Congress will not be held to preempt existing state law unless is the clear intent of Congress to legislate exclusively in the area.

Facts
The Plaintiff was equipped with a pacemaker made by the Defendant. Three years later, the pacemaker failed due to a defect in the lead, requiring emergency surgery. Plaintiff filed suit in a Florida State Court, alleging negligence and strict liability. Defendant removed the case to federal court and filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that 21 U.S.C. Section: 360k(a) preempted the state common law claims. The trial court dismissed the entire complaint. The 11th Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. Both parties sought review by the United States Supreme Court (Supreme Court).

Issue
Does the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (the Act) [90 Stat. 539 (1976)] preempt a state common law negligence action against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective medical device?

Held
No. Affirmed in part and reversed in part.

Discussion
If Congress had clearly intended to preempt state law, the Supreme Court would have no choice and the manufacturer would only have to abide by the federal law. In this case, the Supreme Court determined that Congress had not expressed a clear intention to preempt these state common laws.
