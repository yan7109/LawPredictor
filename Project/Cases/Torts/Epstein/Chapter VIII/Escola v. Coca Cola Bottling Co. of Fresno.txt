150 P.2d 436 (Cal. 1944).

Brief Fact Summary
A bottle of Coke manufactured by Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Fresno (Defendant) exploded in Escola’s (Plaintiff’s) hand. Absolute liability was imposed on Defendant.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A manufacturer incurs absolute liability when an article that he has placed on the market, knowing that it is to be used without inspection, proves to have a defect that causes injury to humans.

Facts
Plaintiff was a waitress, and one of her duties was to stock the refrigerator with bottles of Coca-Cola. On one occasion, a bottle exploded in Plaintiff’s hand as she was putting it into the refrigerator, causing serious injury. Plaintiff sued Defendant, claiming that Defendant was negligent in selling “bottles containing said beverage which on account of excessive pressure of gas or by reason of some defect in the bottle was dangerous.and likely to explode.” The jury returned a verdict for Plaintiff. Defendant appealed.

Issue
Is Defendant absolutely liable for its failure to inspect a bottle of Coca-Cola that proves to have a defect that causes injury to Plaintiff?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The majority held that the inference of negligence under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur shifted the burden of proof to the Defendant. In J. Traynor’s concurring opinion, Defendant is strictly liable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff need not utilize the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.
