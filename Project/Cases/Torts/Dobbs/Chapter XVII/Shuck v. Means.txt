Brief Fact Summary
An automobile owned by Hertz, leased to George A. Codling (Codling) and driven by David Lynn Means (Means) struck an automobile in which Shuck was a passenger. Means was uninsured and the parties stipulated he had been negligent.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under the Minnesota Safety Responsibility Act (the Act), when an owner gives permission to another to drive his car, who in turn gives permission to a third party, the owner will be liable for accidents caused by the third person.

Facts

Issue
Is a car rental agency liable under the Act when one of its cars is leased to one person, but operated by another in violation of the rental agreement?

Held
Yes. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The need for owner-consent statutes has lessened because of “omnibus clauses” in standard automobile liability insurance clauses, providing that the insurance applies to anyone using the automobile with the permission of the owner.
