518 S.W.2d 512, 1974 Tenn.

Brief Fact Summary
The Defendant, Currey (Defendant), negligently performed a surgery on the Plaintiff, Teeters (Plaintiff) that was intended to prevent future pregnancy. Plaintiff did not discover the negligence until three years later when she gave birth. Plaintiff sued and Defendant answered claiming the statute of limitations as a bar to recovery.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Under Tennessee law, the statute of limitations in medical malpractice actions begins to run when the plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should have discovered the negligent injury.

Facts
On June 6, 1970 the Plaintiff underwent surgery at the advice of her doctor to prevent future pregnancy. On March 9, 1973, Plaintiff delivered a premature child, with severe complications. Plaintiff initiated a malpractice suit, alleging that the Defendant’s previous surgery was negligently performed. This suit was initiated over three years after the operation, but approximately eleven months after discovering the pregnancy. The Defendant pleaded the statute of limitations in his answer.

Issue
Was the trial court correct in holding that the cause of action accrues when the injury occurs, so as to begin the running of the statute of limitations?

Held
No. Judgment reversed and remanded.

Discussion
The statute of limitations is a complete bar to actions. The time period by which to bring an action varies in length, with most states imposing a two or three year limitation for actions sounding in tort.
