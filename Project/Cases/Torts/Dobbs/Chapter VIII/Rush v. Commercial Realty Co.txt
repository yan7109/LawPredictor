The Plaintiff, tenant Rush (Plaintiff), was injured when she fell through the floor of a detached privy. Plaintiff won a suit against the Defendant landlord, Commercial Realty Co. (Defendant). The Defendant appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Implied assumption of the risk is applicable only when a plaintiff voluntarily encounters a known risk.

Plaintiff fell nine feet into the accumulation at the bottom and had to be removed with the use of a ladder. Defendant appeals the trial court verdict, claiming that it erred in refusing a nonsuit and erred in refusing to direct a verdict for the Defendant.

Issue
Did the trial court err by not directing a verdict in favor of the Defendant based on Plaintiff’s contributory negligence or assumption of the risk?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
