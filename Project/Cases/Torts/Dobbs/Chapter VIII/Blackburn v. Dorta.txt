Facts
Three cases where consolidated by the Supreme Court of Florida to determine if the doctrine of implied assumption of the risk was viable as an absolute bar to recovery subsequent to adoption of comparative negligence.

Issue
Is the doctrine of implied assumption of the risk still viable as an absolute bar to recovery subsequent to adoption of comparative negligence?

Held
No. The affirmative defense of implied assumption of the risk is merged into the defense of comparative negligence.

Discussion
Express assumption of the risk is a contractual obligation such as a release signed by a plaintiff. This Court expressed no opinions on the subject.
