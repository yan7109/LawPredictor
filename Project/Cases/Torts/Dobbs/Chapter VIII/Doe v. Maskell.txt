342 Md. 684, 679 A.2d 1087,1996 Md.

Brief Fact Summary
The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) granted summary judgment to school officials on the Plaintiffs’ claims of sexual, physical and psychological abuse. Plaintiffs sought review.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
The discovery rule holds that a cause of action accrues when plaintiff knew or should have known that actionable harm has been done to him.

Facts
Two young women, Doe and Roe, (Plaintiffs) attended a Baltimore City parochial school between 1967 and 1971. During this period, they allege, they were repeatedly subjected to a variety of abuse, sexual, physical and psychological. Plaintiffs, citing “repression”, claimed they did not begin to become consciously aware of the abuse until 1982. The statute of limitations barred any action for recovery after a period of three years beyond the Plaintiffs’ eighteenth birthdays. Defendants contended they were thus barred from bringing the action. The trial court agreed, and granted summary judgment.

Issue
Does the discovery rule in conjunction with the time-bar of the statute of limitations on civil actions apply to cases of allegedly repressed and recovered memories?

Held
Yes. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court with costs. The court framed the issue in terms of ascertaining whether repression existed as a phenomenon separate and apart from the normal process of forgetting. The court concluded there was no way to distinguish the two processes scientifically, and thus they should be treated the same legally.

Discussion
The broader, if tangential, issue presented in Doe v. Maskell was that of “repressed memory” syndrome, about which experts did not agree. Two schools of thought emerged: the scientific and the therapeutic. The latter gave greater credence to the alleged phenomenon. The former, not surprisingly, took the empirical approach and tended to deny its existence due to the absence of objective data.
