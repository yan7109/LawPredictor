46 Cal.App.3d 686, 120 Cal.Rptr. 354 (Ct. App. 1975)

Brief Fact Summary
Defendant, Western Bank and Trust Company (Bank), sold its controlling majority shares in Alfred S. Johnson Incorporated (Corporation) to Raymond J. Mattison, without conducting adequate investigation into the public records.  Consequently, Mattison looted Corporation.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
A controlling majority shareholder must exercise good faith and fairness in selling its controlling shares in a company, which includes the duty to reasonably investigate whether a potential buyer is a looter.

Facts
Corporation was incorporated by Alfred S. Johnson in 1955 to process color photographs to be reproduced in printed form.  The 100 shares in Corporation were owed as follows:  Johnson owned 70 shares; Respondent, James DeBaun, Corporation’s primary salesman, owned 20 shares; and Respondent, Walter Stephens, its production manager, owned 10 shares.

Issue
Whether Bank as the controlling majority shareholder had a duty to the Corporation and minority shareholders to act as a reasonably prudent person in selling its controlling shares? If so, did Bank breach its duty? If Bank breached its duty, whether the trial court properly awarded damages?

Held
Affirmed.  Remanded to determine additional amount payable to Respondents for Counsel fees due as a result of the appeal.

Discussion
Bank became directly aware of facts that would alert a prudent person that Mattison was likely to loot the corporation.  Such factors included:  Bank knew from the Dun & Bradstreet report of Mattison’s poor financial history; it knew of Mattison’s past fraudulent conduct; and it knew that Mattison’s only method of paying for Corporation’s shares was in Corporation’s assets.  Consequently, Bank had a duty to Corporation and its minority shareholders to act as a reasonably prudent person to further investigate Mattison.
