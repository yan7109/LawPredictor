977 S.W.2d 543 (Tex. 1998)

Brief Fact Summary
A partner is expelled from the partnership for accusing a senior partner of overbilling a major client.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Partners in at-will partnerships have the freedom to expel another partner if the offending partner damages the personal confidence and trust of the partnership.

Facts
Plaintiff, Colette Bohatch, is a partner at the Washington DC., office of Defendant, Butler & Binion (firm).  After reviewing internal firm reports, Plaintiff was concerned that John McDonald, a senior partner, was overbilling a major client, Pennzoil.  Plaintiff brought her concern to another partner in the office, Richard Powers.  Together, they reviewed McDonald’s time diary.

Issue
Whether the fiduciary duty of a partnership creates an exception to the at-will nature of partnerships where a partner was expelled from a partnership for reporting suspected over billing by another partner? Whether Defendant breached the partnership agreement by reducing Plaintiff’s tentative distribution for 1991 to zero without notice.

Held
The Court of Appeals judgment is affirmed.

Dissent
Punishing a partner for her good faith effort to alert her partners to the possible overbilling of a client in compliance with the Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct is a breach of the partner’s fiduciary duty to one another and discourages others from reporting another lawyer’s unethical behavior.

Discussion
A charge that a partner overbilled, whether true or not, has a profound effect on the personal confidence and trust essential to the partnership.
