Synopsis of Rule of Law
In civil cases in which diversity is the basis of Federal Court jurisdiction, where a situation is governed by a federal rule, it the federal rule, not the state rule, which the court must apply.

Facts
Plaintiff, an Ohio resident filed suit in Massachusetts Federal District Court claiming damages for personal injuries resulting from an automobile accident in South Carolina, allegedly caused by the negligence of Defendant, a Massachusetts resident deceased at the time of filing. Defendant’s executor, also a Massachusetts citizen, was named as the defendant.  Service was made by leaving copies of the summons and the complaint with Defendant’s wife at his residence, in compliance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d) (1) then in effect.  Defendant filed an answer stating the action could not be maintained because service was done in accords with the Massachusetts General Laws governing service of process.  The District Court granted Defendant’s motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Issue
Whether State or Federal rules should apply to service of process in a civil action in federal court on diversity jurisdiction.

Held
The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the Circuit Court’s decision, holding that the Federal rule regarding service is the standard against which the District Court should have measured the adequacy of the service.

Discussion
In this case the Supreme Court is distancing itself from the earlier outcome-determinative test for deciding whether to apply Federal or State law.  Instead, the Supreme Court here is holding that where an existing Federal rule squarely governs the situation that the parties are contesting, the Federal rule is controlling.
