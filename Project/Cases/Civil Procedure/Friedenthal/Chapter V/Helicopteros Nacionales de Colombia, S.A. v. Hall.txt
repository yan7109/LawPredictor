22 Ill.466 U.S. 408, 104 S. Ct. 1868, 80 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1984)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiffs, representatives of the estates of former employees of Defendant, sued Defendant, a helicopter company, in Texas court after a helicopter crash in Peru killed several employees. Defendant is a Colombia corporation which was engaged in a joint venture based in Texas and had some contacts with Texas pertaining to the purchasing of helicopters and the training of its pilots. Defendant moved to dismiss the case based on lack of personal jurisdiction.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
For a court to exercise general in personam jurisdiction, the defendant must engage in systematic and continuous contacts with the forum state unless the defendant’s contacts are related to the cause of action.

Facts
Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A., Defendant, a Colombia corporation that provides helicopters for oil and construction companies, was hired by Consorcio, a Peruvian association, and its venture, WSH (a venture based in Texas). The contract between Defendant and the joint venture said that all parties were residents of Peru and controversies arising out of the contract would be subject to jurisdiction in Peruvian courts.

Issue
Are purchasing products and training employees in the forum state, even on a regular basis, sufficient contacts to exercise in personam jurisdiction when the action does not arise from the contact with the state?

Held
No. Judgment reversed.

Dissent
J. Brennan: Purposeful availment of the benefits of the laws of the forum state is the test used to determine whether or not exercising jurisdiction offends notions of fair play and substantial justice. Because Defendant bought many items from Texas for many years, they did purposefully avail themselves of the benefits of Texas laws.

Discussion
In order to assert general jurisdiction, as opposed to specific jurisdiction over the defendant, the conduct need not be related but must be substantial. In this case, the majority holds that notwithstanding the fact that Defendant had some contact with the forum state, the contacts must be continuous and systematic, i.e., not just numerous.
