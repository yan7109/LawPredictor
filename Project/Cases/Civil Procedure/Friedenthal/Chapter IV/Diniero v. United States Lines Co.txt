22 Ill.288 F.2d 595 (2d Cir. 1961)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff, a seaman, sued Defendant, a ship owner and Plaintiff’s former employer for back injuries Plaintiff allegedly suffered at work. The trial judge submitted written interrogatories and forms for a general verdict to the jury but later withdrew the written interrogatories. The jury returned a general verdict for Plaintiff and Defendant appealed.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Withdrawal of written interrogatories previously submitted to the jury is not an abuse of discretion when the purpose for doing so is to remedy the confusion created by an unclear and ambiguous question previously submitted. There was no violation of Rule 49 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because a confusing and poorly worded question is not a “material” question or one that is “necessary to reach a verdict.”

Facts
Julio DiNiero (Plaintiff) sued United States Lines Co. (Defendant) for back injuries he suffered at work. Plaintiff worked for Defendant, a ship owner, as a seaman. Plaintiff alleged that he was required to crouch down, remove a floor plate and use a wrench in order to operate a valve. This continuous action allegedly caused Plaintiff’s back injury.

Issue
Is it an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to submit special interrogatories to the jury and then later withdraw all of the questions if the jury finds one of the questions confusing and the judge’s explanation of the question does not resolve the jury’s confusion?

Held
No. Judgment affirmed.

Discussion
The court’s opinion illustrates the trial judge’s discretion to resolve jury confusion regarding a special verdict when the question involved is ambiguous and confusing.
