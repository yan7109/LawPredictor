Facts
The Plaintiffs brought a wrongful death claim against the Defendants, United Air Lines, Inc. (Defendants), in which the jury had entered a general verdict accompanied by special interrogatories.

The Plaintiffs asked the Court to either (i) submit additional interrogatories to the jury; (ii) calculate the verdict on the basis of the answers given to the questions or (iii) grant a new trial.

Issue
Whether the findings of fact in the answers given by the jury to the special interrogatories were consistent with each other and whether one or more, if consistent with each other, were inconsistent with the general verdict fixing the total sum of damages to the Plaintiffs resulting from the death of the decedent.

Held
The jury’s findings of fact in the special interrogatories control over the general verdict.
