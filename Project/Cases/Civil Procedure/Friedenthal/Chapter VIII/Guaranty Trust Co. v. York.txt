22 Ill.326 U.S. 99, 65 S. Ct. 1464, 89 L. Ed. 2079 (1945)

Brief Fact Summary
Plaintiff sued Defendant in equity for breach of fiduciary duty in federal court based on diversity of citizenship. Defendant argued that the state statute of limitations had run and that the court was required to apply the state statute of limitations under the Erie doctrine.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
In a diversity suit brought in equity, an equitable right created by a law of the state whose laws govern the case must be followed by a federal district court if applying the federal law would significantly affect the outcome of the case.

Facts
Guaranty Trust Company (Defendant) was a trustee of Van Sweringen Corporation. Defendant loaned money to corporations affiliated with the Van Sweringen. Van Sweringen was having trouble meeting its financial obligations, so Defendant and other banks worked out a plan that Defendant would offer to purchase notes by paying $500 and twenty shares of Van Sweringen’s stock for each $1000 note. Plaintiff received $6000 of the notes from a donor who had not accepted Defendant’s offer. Plaintiff brought a diversity suit against Defendant alleging breach of fiduciary duty by fraud and misrepresentation, which was an equitable remedy. The Court of Appeals found that if the suit was brought in equity, a federal district court was not required to apply the state statute of limitations that would govern similar suits in state courts, even though the exclusive basis of federal jurisdiction was diversity. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.

Issue
Are federal courts permitted to grant equitable remedies that are consistent with state substantive law when an identical remedy would not be available in state courts?

Held
First issue: No. Second issue: Yes. Reversed.

Discussion
This case demonstrates that federal courts sitting in both law and equity should apply state law if required by the Erie doctrine.
