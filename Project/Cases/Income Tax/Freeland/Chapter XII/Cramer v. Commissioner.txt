55 T.C. 1125, 1971 U.S. Tax Ct.

Brief Fact Summary
Petitioner took property tax deductions on three different properties.  One she owned outright, one was owned by her mother, and one she had sold to William Osborn but retained title.

She deducted these property tax payments on her 1965 and 1966 returns.
