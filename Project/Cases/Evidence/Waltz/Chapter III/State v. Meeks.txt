Brief Fact Summary
The defendant, Meeks (the “defendant”), appealed his conviction of First Degree murder, claiming the statements of the victim were hearsay and that he should be afforded the opportunity to confront the victim.

Synopsis of Rule of Law

While there were various witness accounts, the defendant sought an appeal based on the admission of the officer’s statement that the dying victim said “Meeks shot me.”

Discussion
