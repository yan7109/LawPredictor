Brief Fact Summary
The seven defendants were convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy after they participated in a scheme to defraud insurance providers.  The defendants purchased numerous hospitalization policies and proceeded to stage numerous accidents which led to hospitalization.  The nature of the offense provided a range of documents that were produced as evidence.

Synopsis of Rule of Law
Higher courts will apply an abuse-of-discretion standard of review when reviewing admission of evidence.

Facts
The seven defendants conspired to defraud hospitalization insurance providers.  The defendants routinely staged accidents in order to recover payments from several policies per hospital stay.  The fraud resulted in the creation of numerous records, such as medical records, that were used at trial to convict the conspirators.  On appeal, the defendants challenged the denial of their motion to change venue, as well as challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain their convictions and challenging the severity of the sentences.  The defendants also challenged fourteen evidentiary rulings.

Issue
There are several issues raised, with the primary issues regarding whether the trial court abused their discretion in the admissibility of evidence?

Held
The court affirmed the lower court rulings, including all fourteen rulings on the admissibility of evidence.

Discussion
A trial court’s rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence will typically stand unless there is an abuse of discretion by the trial court.
