Facts
Knapp (D) killed a deputy sheriff in Hagerstown who attempted to arrest him and D claimed that he murdered in self-defense.  People around the town had told D that the deputy killed the old man.  The prosecutor then showed that the deputy did not kill the old man, that the old man died of natural causes.  D was convicted of murder and he then appealed, claiming that the real issue was whether D had heard that the deputy had killed the old man.<span class='heading'>Issue.</span>  Is evidence relevant of a particular item if it tends to support whether proof of that evidence would assist to resolve the  to a central issue of a case?

Held
Yes, the judgment is affirmed.

Discussion
The court shows that admissibility of evidence in this case indicates that if even a slight inference can be made, then the court should admit the evidence of a collateral fact.  In actual practice, the courts tend to weigh the value of the evidence against the amount of time that will be consumed by its introduction.  The more there is a direct connection to the case; the court will be more liberal.
