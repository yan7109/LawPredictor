Facts
Oregon passed a statute limiting the number of hours women may work in factories and laundries to a maximum of ten hours per day. The statute is being challenged as unconstitutional.

Is it proper for the court to take judicial notice of legislation and other sources of opinion?

Held
The United States Supreme Court upheld the Oregon statute limiting the hours and found it proper to take judicial notice of “matters of general knowledge.”
